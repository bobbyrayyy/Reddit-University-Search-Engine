Soon-to-be-forgotten,4,"Omg. Are you a new mod? I tried to request for the subreddit *twice* and they didn't pass my requests haha.

I'm glad at least this subreddit is revived."
Schnoobs69,2,Awesome to hear this! I’m a prospective exchange student and I was bummed out when I couldn’t ask any questions here
TerreeHermes,2,Nice!
Eurito1,1,There were a few [reddit requests](https://www.reddit.com/r/redditrequest/search?q=smu&restrict_sr=on&include_over_18=off&sort=new&t=all) recently to mod this subreddit. Perhaps you can reach out to them?

One-Tail-5082,1,"hiii, y3 acct student here!

1)Generally, modules based in accountancy is like 1.5h lesson, 0.5 breaks, 1h+ lesson to the end. Most of them are lecture base, with allocated time to do some class practices. Honestly contents for acct are pretty heavy and you have to either do some work before/after class in order to absorb every content well. For other modules, it varies. Some have weekly presentations by each group, or interaction activities (feels like I'm in primary school sometimes but its literally where the fun is), etcetc. But regardless which modules, all the professors (and teaching assistants) are willing to help if you consult them after class, or drop them an email, or even set a time to meet after class. Generally the teaching style here is just: contents-examples-class practice  


2)Accounting mods generally don't emphasise much on class part. Lets say for non-accounting modules, there may be 15-20% of grades allocated to just participating, some even more nonsense ones will evaluate based on the number of times you open your mouth (e.g. raise your hands n speak 3 times a lesson to get an A). For those mods, you can try your best to just speak up, sometimes to clarify concepts, sometimes to share something simple (e.g.: answering questions on: what is resilience? and then I will just google and read it out even though everyone can do it too).

As for accounting mods, many times the class participation grade is 10%, but sometimes just attending class would already be like a passing grade. Profs there generally aren't too hard on you to speak up in class, although many appreciate your responses so that they can move on in class (i swear the classes always get delayed or stuck cuz no one volunteers to share things). Even if you say something wrong, at least you will get corrected. Generally not much pressure to speak up compared to those non-acct mods.

3) For culture, I'm not too sure since I'm the covid batch and don't have much interactions. But even if I'm not from the covid batch, I will still do the same (9/10 times i go home after school) since I am probably drained out from the interactions + 3 or 6 hours lectures (if there's 2 modules).

But I observe many people having the time of their lives whilst in SMU, making friends (or acquaintances) here and there from group projects, CCAs, etc. So I believe the culture doesn't matter as long as you be yourself and have fun (within your own definition)? HAHA hope i helped, all the best!"

just adding on to what the others said, but don’t chase hype just bc of good results ah"
sanguineuphoria,3,"Think about what you want to do and apply for that course. The worst thing would be to come out of the 4 years of uni and realise that you hate the job and can't stick it out any longer, but you don't have the skills / paper qualifications to do another job that you would prefer. I am in law and there are people around me who never wanted to do law in the first place but applied because of parental pressure / just applied what they could get with their score are regretting it months into practice.

If you don't know what you want to do, you could take this time to try applying for some internships and see how the day to day work is like.

Do also note that being a legal advisor to tech companies (in house counsel) usually entails working in private practice for several years to hone your skills and build up knowledge before you are able to hold your own and provide advice."
fuckyoudanke,2,"imo you should decide on your desired career path. if you wanna go into law, go for smu law. if you wanna go into tech, go for IS. if you are interested in business roles like strategy, marketing or finance, go for business. workload wise nothing is easy since this is uni, unless you are one of those geniuses."
shadowz0,2,"For law, you better have good time management as the readings are massive for law mods, if you decide to pair with IS/CS, good luck :) most likely you won't have enough time in the day to excel in both unless u have photographic memory or don't sleep. Coding wise, scis will teach you from scratch but you have to put in the time to learn and master coding.  


Smu's is most popular with finance with pathways into IB and high finance with econ and double major finance(math heavy). but the other degrees are also viable."
fireflight13x,1,"Use your NLB Udemy account (Google how to log in) and go try a course on Python on Udemy. This gives you free access to some coding courses that are pretty decent.

Since you've never tried coding before, this will give you some good exposure to the very basics of the most widely used coding language. Try it for 2-4 hours or so and see how you feel about it. It's far from sufficient by any measure, but if your instinctive reaction to it is a disliking, that's quite a clear no to anything CS. If, however, you feel excited and enjoy the logic behind putting the code together, it might be possible to explore more. Don't worry if you feel some confusion, the main question is whether it excites you.

This is by no means a clear indicator of how well you'll do, but it's at least a litmus test to tell you how you might feel towards coding and whether you dislike it or not. That's a vital part of any CS course. If you do end up taking Law+CS, you can then continue the courses before your uni starts also so that you have some prep."

infernoKings,1,"It really depends if you want to be stronger in technical skills, or more of soft skills (communicating with stakeholders, product management, etc). 

I have multiple interns coming from nus, ntu, sit, smu, and the SIT interns tend to be better technically due to the rigorous course they’re put through, that is of course, if you really grind it out and manage to pick up the concepts fast. The SMU interns on the other hand, are better in theory as compared to practical, probably due to way the course is structured."
amey_wemy,0,"SMU IS is more towards product management from what I've heard and seen. And most cases of ""does not limit your options"" tend to be towards software engineering. I'd imagine it to be significantly harder to land roles in data science (requires stats/math) or cyber security

Not really... Its an old stereotype. Not more than other schools imo

For MBA, its much more important to have a good story and reason for doing an MBA, as well as a relevant job that contributes to your story. Where your degree is from matters much less than these two things

Its not like NUS is that much more internationally recognised anyway for MBA. Plenty of SMU students go overseas for further studies after graduating

Steelhound,1,"There are multiple factors, your GPA, your year of study and your resume. Feel free to pm me for more information."
Koufas,6,"There is no GPA requirement for exchange strictly speaking, but since the popular schools for exchange have limited slots they will prioritise students for a specific school by GPA. So if you think your GPA is not competitive might be better to apply for less popular schools

My opinion is that GPA isnt everything. It is impossible to compete against perfect 4.0s, so we have to compete on fit. Thats a lot easier said than done, though

If you feel like your GPA is not competitive enough, you should try and do more internships for more experience which will give you an edge. For my next internship for Summer at a bank, even though my GPA is not the highest and I dont have prior banking internships they still took me because, according to them, I will need the least training due to my past relevant experiences. Nothing to do with GPA. The person who hired me explicitly said that GPA is not the most relevant metric

If your GPA is too low you might be filtered out by HR of some of the larger firms, but imo, skills are much more important than GPA. You just have to have an outlet to show these skills - be it more internships, your own sideprojects, CCAs, etc

Most of the bigger firms are also transitioning to GBA for first round of interview rather than screening based on GPA/CV anyway so...

GPA does matter - but it matters much less than everyone thinks it does"

Koufas,5,"Hello

I'd suggest going on the SMU tender website to see what laptops suit you. It is not only cheaper, but it will be delivered to the IT Team at SMU who will pre-install everything you need for you already

Generally 16gb RAM will be fine and is future-proof enough - although if you are looking to do some gaming 32GB is definitely much better and appropriate if you are looking to play the higher end games. 16GB should be fine for most but depending on games, 32 might be better in some cases only. You can upgrade some of the specs to what you want so its up to you depending on your budget

But since you are doing CS. Hmm 32GB might be future-proofing idea I'd think? 16GB should generally still be fine for uni though. For work your workplace will generally assign you a company laptop so dont have to worry so much about that. Most of the time data is stored on the cloud anyway so idt you absolutely need 32GB

Other than RAM the rest of the specs is generally quite flexible. Maybe upgrading your storage space to 512 or even 1TB? But you can always get an external harddrive later on or something so its not so bad

I am currently waiting on my Dell Latitude which I purchased through the SMU tender (it has some upgraded specs as well). I upgraded it slightly to have 16GB RAM. You can just e-mail the salesperson through the e-mail listed on the website and they will get back to you and guide you through"
Tzuyuuuuuuuuuuuuu,2,"General advice, not particular about SMU, just came across this post. I don’t know the laptops they recommend/ have on sale/allow discounts. 

A random general laptop advice, don’t buy dell laptops, they are shit. Specs are good but they don’t last. (Subjective to individuals, but generally they break faster compared to other brands). This is especially for those “gaming laptops” under the DELL brand. The rest are still bad, but the gaming ones are absolute crap. 

Also, gaming laptops are fine, but do note the weight price factors of it. This largely depends on your budget. 

Generally speaking, it depends on what game you want to play. If you want to play triple a games, on a laptop, find one with a better graphics card. This are not good examples, but a ROG zephyrus is a thin gaming laptop. MSI has a few too if I remember correctly. This is a bad advice, but if you really want to prevent any chances of the laptop being bad, don’t buy something like a gaming laptop from ASUS, like the tuf(the older ones had heating issues, idk about the current one). You can buy from their sub brand, ROG. 

 If you have another computer at home, a desktop, or anything that can run these games, then just get something that’s decent enough to play games and do work. 

The Acer swift 3 you mentioned is a pretty decent choice I guess. I can’t give you any advice cause I’m not too proficient with the current laptop choices+idk your budget. So yeah, this all the advice I can think of on the spot. Not everything will apply, but hope this helps."

chdbejchsjxn,2,"smu cs y1s2. most people here use a mb(60-70%) its fast(m1 and m2 chips). here are some pros and cons for windows

Pros:
- all installation guide’s definitely given for windows
- easier to understand and pinpoint errors

Cons:
- Have to deal with linux server for cs101
- annoying if you are coding with a home pc and laptop(C files on linux cannot be saved on cloud)
- windows update is very annoying, and causes anxiety during exams

Lastly, I would not recommend playing games on your laptop
1. gaming laptops are not built to last (heats up easily and all)
2. they are very expensive
3. storage size is limited on laptop

IMO, just get any non-gaming laptop thats fast"

Note that the more time you spend on schoolwork, the less time you have to develop yourself in other ways eg taking a LOA for a 6 month internship, not able to network as much as your peers due to less time, not able to pursue CCA/project-related endeavors... Trade-offs are there as well - I would not suggest pursuing an early graduation unless you are really hard-strapped for cash even after you start working and will not be able to pay back loans + finance your needs at the time

Specialist_Panda_411,2,Yes I graduated in 3.5 years and many people in my batch did as well. Mostly because covid hit during my exchange period so most of us didn’t do exchange.

Koufas,3,">I'm thinking of statistics because of the career prospect which is more diverse than econs since stats can be applied to any fields

You can apply plenty of skills you pick up in econs to other fields as well - and econs has a generous amount of statistics/quant skills if you choose to take classes in that direction

>and the skills picked up from stats major is more useful than econs i guess since econs is more theoretical

Comparing SMU Econs to NUS Econs or NTU Econs, imo we are the least theory-heavy of the 3 and there is more application-based learning/questions

>However, i truly enjoy what I've learnt from econs in JC which pushes me to take it up as a major in uni

Econ in JC is very different from Econ in Uni. Econ in Uni is math/calculus/algebra heavy. I'd say that the material we learn in JC is more of a basic intro to econ research/global markets rather than econ itself as a discipline

>Im still unsure what i wanna do in the future but probably in the public sector doing stuff related to finance/analysis-based jobs

Econ is necessary for ES in MTI - you must have taken econometrics. Otherwise both paths can lead you to these roles. You can also opt for a minor/second major in Finance. Analytics-wise, I think SMU has a lot of opportunities for internships, projects and hackathons though

>and I'm not planning to stay in the hostel:

Tbh if you're not interested in hall life, I think SMU is much better due to the traveling + convenience alone

>NUS:  
>  
>PROS:  
>  
>\- CHS -> flexibility to choose mods and majors between FASS and FOS

Yes NUS has a wider variety of modules

>\- S/U system

SMU has a S/U system as well - albeit to a lesser extent. We can only P/F two modules that are not our major cores. FWIW I have heard from my peers that have done local exchange at other local unis that they generally don't have a good time because students in other schools tend to not put in as much effort as they do in group discussions/projects 

>\- cheaper fees

SMU has plenty of financial aid/bursaries/scholarships you can try for - they are often underutilised

>CONS:  
>  
>\- competitive

SMU can be competitive too. Anywhere can be competitive if you make it to be so - just have to manage accordingly

>SMU:  
>  
>PROS:  
>  
>\- class part and small class size which encourage u to speak up and have more interactions with the prof

While this is true, NUS also has some level of participation. Not as much as SMU but its still there

>\- guaranteed 2nd major

2nd major can be a bit of a trap - you don't necessarily need a 2nd major to take more modules that are aligned with your future career but not under your own major

Its a good option but you don't always have to exercise it

>\- better career coaches

I think that the network + CCA culture in SMU does much, much more for one's career than our career coaches. Academic CCAs in SMU are the real gems imo because they are not just super relvant, but alum of the CCAs generally keep in touch and are very open to networking etc

Career coaches are good and all too, but CCAs in SMU is something i feel is super slept on. Even the non-academic CCAs like Broadcast & Entertainment have deep, deep connections within their industry (eg Royce Lee and Hossan Leong), so if you are really passionate about something SMU is a place that generally helps you pursue it

>CONS:  
>  
>\- located in CBD which feels like I'm gg to work and not school  
>  
>Have addressed the other two cons earlier

But for this - honestly I think being in the CBD is so much better. It makes it easier for me to leave office for a part-time internship early or take a half-day or a long lunch to hang out with friends in school. Or during the Summer if I want to attend school events at night I can just do it without the worry of needing to travel so far

If I need to go for an interview, it is really just a stone's throw away and I don't have to allocate a half-day for it just to travel to and fro

If I choose to WFH from school, it is easy for me to pop into my internship office to do something and then go back

As for the vibes. I think my definition of school is. An experience that is helping me to grow while being in a safe space that I can enjoy with my friends. Sure we don't have hall life, but if you're not interested in hall life I don't see that much you'll be missing out on

I love the city campus because its super convenient for me to buy something and come back to school, or go out with friends etc... Doesn't seem like Im going to ""work"" when I can go to school in the morning, have lunch @ Funan with friends, go back to school for studying/CCA, have dinner @ Bencoolen, go catch a movie @ Dhoby, then have supper @ Jilani's or drinks at the Prinsep stretch

If anything, I feel like we get to enjoy more of the non-work stuff around the area because we are just around so much anyway

&#x200B;

>\- I heard the class part can be daunting and intense

Is it daunting? Yeah it can be. I have been scared of class parting even as a Y3 because it is a module I am not familiar with. But intense? Honestly this is probably said by people not in SMU, or who have left SMU about 10 years ago. 99% of us are not class-part hungry monsters who raise our hands at the first chance we get for every morsel of class-part scores. We are just normal youths around your age doing the best we can and managing as we go along.

Its really not as intense as most people online make it out to be

>\- food options can be limited

No, hard disagree - because you are so close to areas outside of school it is so much easier to access a wide variety of food. There are budget options as well - cai fan for less than $4.00, YTF for $5.00... Sunshine Plaza, Fortune Centre, Bencoolen coffee shop, Funan, Dhoby, Cathay, Food Dynasty @ Lazada One, GRiD... If you feel like treating yourself there are options, if you feel like eating something nice there are options, if you feel like budgeting and eating cheap there are options. Food options are in no way limited at all - all of these places are max a 10 minute walk from school"
Cupcake_Cookies,4,"In my opinion SMU’s lack of option to SU is not a Con, its not fun doing group projects with people who decided to SU the course and just go MIA.

For class part it’s better to get familiar with speaking up early and refine your skills over the next 4 years 

In my experience profs will generally frown slightly if a student is just speaking for the sake of speaking, so it really encourages us to talk properly and not just ‘wayang’.

Most profs understand that first year students may not be use to the class part, and will adjust the marks if they see effort from the students, and award them marks accordingly if they see improvement, so it’s not that bad if you stick to taking first year mods in your first semester 😊"
FurballTheHammy,3,"You may want to consider the flexibility of CHS to be a con, depending on your skill sets.

E.g. I know friends who are literature and linguistics majors in NUS who have to pick up coding as a common mod. 

So if you really hate the random irrelevant mods to your study, e.g. random literature/linguistics mod that you need to study as a science/math major. Then yea you should know that the CHS batch of students who joined in 2021/2020 were quite messed up with their common mods. There’s S/U options for those but you still need to minimally pass it.

I chose SMU because it’s common mods are actually desirable and not some random “it’s relevant in the 2020s so please pick it up” even though Coding is irrelevant to a language major and etc."
assault_potato1,1,"I'm from NUS Econs, Y2. There is plenty of statistics in Econs, trust me - especially Econometric modules. JC Econs is a piss poor representation of Econs at a uni level. Uni econs is 90% math, and in NUS, there are no ""writing"" modules in the econs core curriculum. So if you want to join econs because you like econs in JC, think again.

Regarding 2nd majors, NUS CHS allows you to declare second majors/minors easily within CHS. For other second majors like computing or business, you'd need to score well for the second major mods to qualify."

But one could also argue that soft skills can be learned while most work places do expect you have good technical knowledge. So perhaps there is a perception out there that the SMU focus too much on building “confidence” but some organisations may prefer humility and technical knowledge and substance. There is a perception out there amongst employers, whether true or not, that SMU students are weaker technically and some seem to fake it till you make it instead of working hard to work on their technical knowledge or depth."

Relatively new to the scene are SMU grads who are better equipped with soft skills and who know how to talk to more than 6 people at once. They’re getting higher starting pays and making the incumbents uncomfortable that the bar is getting raised. 

It’s unfortunate they feel bad about it and need to shit on others to try to make themselves feel better.

But if you already have sufficient experience like say one big name + 1 or 2 other experiences, then pushing for higher GPA is fine too 

In terms of how recruiters assess - it depends on where you are applying to. If you are applying to most MNCs or bigger firms, the first check is the GBA anyway so it really doesn't matter that much

Steelhound,8,Basically the top 33% will get A or A-. A+ is entirely discretionary on the Prof. In general only 1 person per class will get A+. Some classes do not get A+ if the Prof feels that no one earned it. Having summa will definitely be helpful for scholarship.

Schnoobs69,3,"I was an exchange student same time as you this year. It was a wonderful opportunity and it's a fantastic place to be. That being said the difficulty definitely varied, but on average it's pretty rigorous. There's a high emphasis on group work, presenting, and class participation. Classes are also typically 3 hours (only one day a week though). 

1. No idea what the average letter grades are for classes but they are curved. I had one very very difficult course that I passed despite legitimately failing hard (learned a ton though).

2. Taking 4 business courses could be pretty difficult, 4 courses in general is a good chunk of time speaking from experience. With all things though balance is important, especially if you're trying to travel a lot. I would try varying the classes you take to make it a little bit easier. You should also try pushing classes to a few days only so you have that time to travel or do fun stuff.

3. Easy is subjective but here are some classes that I thought were interesting and did fairly well at: MGMT 205 International Business, PPPM 101"
fuckyoudanke,1,"1. for each class usually 30% of students get A+, A or A- cos thats the max no of As that the profs can give. for the bottom 70% it really depends on the prof, some of them will try their best to ensure that the lowest gets a B- while others wont hesitate to give you a fail if they think you deserve to fail

2. i think thats alright, but some modules can be really project intensive and take up a lot of ur time

3. what kind of modules are you looking at? there are modules that are easy in the sense you dont have to be smart to do well in it, but they are project heavy so u still have to invest a lot of time in them"

This_Hawk_2295,3,I don't think you will actually fail the module. However I do hear that for modules like ACCT111 if you fail overall you have to remod and in that case both grades will be computed into your overall GPA.

Usually profs don’t want to fail their students especially for core modules.

Hard_on_Collider,8,"Depends on the mods and the student/prof.

Ive had 5 mod sems that were more relaxing and far less annoying than a 3 mod sem I had.

Mods that you like doing are great. You'll outperform and not stress about them relative to other students taking the same mods. If you do it right, you'd have minimal commitment outside physical lecture hours.

Mods that you start off disliking will be annoying. Mods that you dislike *and* take a lot of time are double or triple the mental effort of normal mods.

I'd usually go with fewer mods for courses you expect to have a lot of trouble with, esp w other time commitments like internships. Having 3 mods that each consume another day for group/homework is worse than 5 mods where you just focus during lectures for like 3 days a week."
DeviousComet465,3,"From what I heard from other seniors as a year 1 student, they highly suggest me don't take a 3 mods sem. This is because in the future, you will still need to take more mods in the end. With a bad start, it is very likely you will face the following choices in the future

* Delay graduation because cannot clear those mods on time
* Have more 5 mods sems than usual

Apart from that, you need to consider that since u took a 3 mods sem, you might find it tough to cope with 5 mods in the future since you are used to taking 3 mods to 4 mods already. If you are in year 2 or above, the mods are likely going to get harder as well. 

Please take note whatever that I hereby mentioned is based on advises provided to me and what I thought regarding taking 3 mods sem. There is no right or wrong answer, it all depends on your current situation and your preferences as well.

Koufas,9,"Depends on your major and 2nd major. Psych majors generally need to be mindful but posc majors have more flexibility for example.

As for which mods, the only reliable way to be frugal is to bid for less popular mods. The most common question is CTRW vs VUCA. Easy save there. Others include less popular core modules.

MC. A good Prof makes the experience more enjoyable and if you click with the Prof it can be really fun. But grade-wise it doesnt make much of a difference imo.

I feel it is a misunderstood mod with some just dismissing it as just ""fluff"" when they are just not used to the structure and content. It is a lot more application and execution compared to other mods which most are not used to. There is only so much a Prof can do even if they are the best in the world.

Id suggest shelling out for a Prof you heard is enjoyable - really makes a difference during the class. But at the same time it depends on your other modules and your preferences. Id rather spend more for a good stats Prof for example. It depends."

For example, I need to put in a lot of effort for math/coding modules, but I have noticed that I tend to do well in my LGST/Law modules. But some students are very comfortable with numbers - but readings much less so. So it really depends on what you consider to be ""light""

What is This Thing called Science is pretty chill. No finals. Forum responses. Class part is really anything goes. There are pre-readings, but you can skip it for the asynchronous lectures and will still be fine. Will probably need to refer to readings for both assignments but keeping up is fine

MC is a mixed bag. The mod has no finals and you don't need to do readings to get by, but if you want to do well in your pitch you'd have to prepare for it. If you don't do well with written exams MC is a good mod to take, because preparing for the mod imo does not involve mugging. If you are more comfortable with relying on tested methods to do well, MC will probably stress you out. But if you are more comfortable with project work, application and figuring things, it would be a manageable module

Global and Transnational Sociology is a relatively light module with a chill Prof. There is a final essay assignment, but no final exam. If you are comfortable with US politics and populism/globalisation you will really enjoy the mod. If you are into global affairs/current affairs, you can safely engage in class material without stressing too much. There are pre-readings, but you should be able to keep up and class part if you are comfortable with these topics. To some, the Prof has some biased views, but he just likes playing Devil's Advocate to challenge your perspective, and he frequently issues statements to challenge the perspective of the class. Sort of like bait to get people to class part. Doubt he is biased as I have disagreed with his viewpoints in my final essay and still did well.

Koufas,9,"The experience has been completely different for me, honestly

Growing up it was never easy for me to make friends, and I never had that ""friend group"" experience all throughout secondary school and JC, or even primary school. It was really lonely having to go through school mostly on my own - although I had a few individual friends here and there, just never as a constant group while I was going through class

While my close friend groups nowadays are from my JC, we only started becoming close when JC was over and actually put in the effort to be actual friends, instead of the usual day-to-day interactions in school

The thing that I realise about uni is that all of the friends I have now are my friends not because of pure happen-stance, but because we put in the effort to remain friends

I genuine do think that most people in SMU do want to make friends - its just that most are not really comfortable with the idea of putting themselves out there/not used to putting in the effort to get close to someone/a friend group. Just gotta keep reaching out until you find the ones that do. I won't say that I'm close to everyone in my CCA, but I've made pretty good friends from there and I'd say that they are way more than just hi-bye friends. Not everyone is like this of course, and it did take some time - but I think that making the effort to connect will eventually lead to some results. 

I've even made friends from this subreddit (who I know will badger me about this comment later) and have bidded with a few of them for a few classes/have plans to bid with them for 1 or 2 mods in the next few sems. This doesn't mean that I made friends with everyone here - but I know that the few friends I have that choose to stick by me are doing so not because it is convenient, but because they want to

If you feel like bidding with friends might ruin your friendships due to project-related groups, why not just choose 1 or 2 people to bid with for 1 or 2 classes? You don't have to bid as a group for everything - and most students in SMU bid with just a friend or two for different modules

There's also much more to friendship than bidding for modules together :P"

You don't need to panic"
yonghongtn,2,"1. IS111 is about practicing consistently after each class and doing all homework and past lab tests. You have to keep practising consistently after each lesson (preferably immediately) to keep pace, not leave it to studying just before the lab test. Programming needs time to internalise.
2. You may want to anticipate assignment deadlines and test dates ahead of time and do 1 or more assignments significantly earlier to avoid a last-minute rush for everything. I believe that you are taking WR, BQ and econs together. It is very likely that lab test 2 will happen at about the same time as your WR A3 and BQ term paper. 
3. IS111 is still 1 module out of \~30 modules that you will take, in the long run, it would have little impact on your GPA. Each mod is weighted equally.
4. It is still possible to get a B-range grade for IS111 if you do well in subsequent lab tests, but it would require significant effort. There's still lab test 2 and finals which are worth 60%. You have to find out what were your issues from the lab test and work on them. Is it the lack of basic understanding of concepts, not enough practice, debugging code taking too much time, or a combination of all 3? Do feel free to ask your prof/instructor/TAs for help ASAP. SMU has really dedicated a lot of resources by having 1 instructor and 2 TAs for each class."
Koufas,2,"Plenty of good advice here already on how to improve your grades

Just wanted to share and add a few things regarding the bigger picture

First, getting a C-grade isn't the end of the world. There are more important things to getting work than a strong GPA - although it certainly helps. But there are plenty of students with GPAs that don't stand out that are getting internships and careers at the firm of their choice as well

Second, coding is not natural. It is normal to struggle. You are definitely not alone, though. I am graduating in Dec 23 and only now starting to take modules with R and I am struggling. I am not the most natural at math, either - so I have really been trying to put in the hours to make sure I know what I'm doing. So its been really rough this sem. Most of my peers are taking lighter modules to pull up their GPA, or taking lesser modules, but my courseload will only get more intense from here. I sometimes can't help but compare myself to my batchmates

But I don't regret my decision at all. You might be overloaded now, but a year from now you will be more comfortable and at least more familiar with how to tackle these problems. Everyone has their own journey in this - which is why it feels lonely at times. But remember that you are not alone in the struggle

Third, learning new things through school will always come at a cost. One of my friends decided to do a double degree at the end of Y2, with IS as his second. And he told me he feels that if he graduates with a GPA that is too high, he would have felt that he did not challenge himself enough in school

This might be a little extreme but it did make reflect on what drives me to go to school: is it to get good grades? Or is it to make myself a better person through learning and self-development? 

All the best. You are not alone"

Prestigious_Nail_279,3,"Hi!  


you mentioned enlisting sometime in November, meaning you're yet to enlist, but received an offer for august 2024 enrolment. I think you'll probably need to inform the school via email ([admissions@smu.edu.sg](mailto:admissions@smu.edu.sg)).

Write in and inform them about your situation.

Good luck!"
endeavourzzz,2,Inform the school and they will reserve a placing for you in 2 years for you to matriculate when you finish NS. You can also exercise early matriculation before you start school for the early term once you ORD but that’s a few months before your school term officially starts in 2025 although it is optional.
endeavourzzz,3,I have friends who took H1 Mathematics and are currently enrolled into Economics but do take note that Economics in University is more quantitative than A Levels and even more than H2 Economics. So take it if you like to work with quantitative data aka numbers.
theartofsadism,1,u just need to take Calculus and get a minimum of B+ to do econs in smu
Koufas,12,"Everyone is different, so its very difficult for someone to comment on how ""hard"" or ""easy"" it is to maintain a certain GPA. It also depends on which school you are in. Someone from IS would find it more difficult to maintain a 3.4 compared to other schools for example

It is also just your first assignment - you're not expected to get an A+ straight away for any mod, or even work. Its a slow, constant progress towards the grade you are working towards to at the end of the semester. Change doesn't happen overnight. And even if it does - not everyone has studies as their priority 

The bottom line is that. You can see the grade that you want as a finishing line. The higher your goals are - the farther you will have to run. If you find that you are not running fast enough to keep up with your goals, you need to make some readjustment somewhere

What that readjustment looks like is not something we can say for sure - it is something only you can decide for yourself as you know yourself best. It can mean spending more time looking at course material, more consults with the TA, visiting the Prof during their OH to talk more about your progress and your mod, spending more time trying to understand the big picture of the mod instead of just mugging/cramming, visiting the Center for English Communication, etc... 

Its a marathon every module every semester to work your way towards the grade you are aiming for. If you are comfortably ahead of your goals, spend more time on other things. Other modules. CCA. Hobbies. Mental health. If you are not keeping pace, increase your speed

Assignments, homework, and quizzes are check-points to allow you to understand if you are all set, or if you need to adjust your pace. It is not the end of the world, nor is it a definite conclusion on how you will perform for the mod at the end of the semester. 

Nor is it a comment on who you are as a person. 

My only A+ in SMU so far came from a mod that I got a C- for in a 20% midterms

So take the assignment as a marker of where you are now, not a final arbiter of how you will perform for the rest of your SMU journey or in life. Growth mindset, right? 

To do well, not just in school but in life in general, I think its much more important to learn how to take the losses and convert them into wins that matter, rather than aiming to win every step of the way. Because there will come a point where for some reason or another you will lose, and you will need to find some way to recover from these losses to make sure you will do better at the next finishing line

Either way, maintaining a B+ throughout will net you a 3.4 cGPA anyway - so I don't see the need to be too worried about a B+ for just your first assignment because if you keep it up you'll still be within the threshold anyway for your goals."
existencezxc,2,"Hi OP, i just graduated from SMU and was once in your shoes too. I had an SMU scholarship and needed to maintain a 3.4 too. I was very anxious in my Y1S1 because I too didn't know how to gauge the effort required, what to expect or what to focus on. The adjustment into uni life was pretty slow too as I am an introvert and class part took a toll on me. 

After so many years in SMU (i did my postgrad here too), I learnt that it's easier to focus on mods that you are confident in scoring and just aim to get the As for those rather than overstretching and  trying to score in everything. I focused on mods that was easier to score in (e.g., mods i was passionate about or those that required skills i was strong in). 

If you think about it, you'll need to get mostly B/B+ and then at least 1 A/A+ for a 3.4, depending on your course load. It's actually pretty doable. I remember that most mods had a B/B+ average anyway. Of cos this depends on your school/major too.

Don't get too dismayed about a B+ for an assignment. Uni life will throw you all sorts of challenges and even if you lose the scholarship, it isn't the end of the world. This is something I had to keep reminding myself all throughout my time at SMU. 

I wasn't a straight As / perpetual deanlist kind of student and had some semesters where I didn't get my 3.4. It really sucked at that time but I eventually moved on and just focused on my next semester. Ended up graduating with a magna for bachelor's and summa for master's. 

In short, don't be too hard on yourself, work hard but also play hard! Hope you'll enjoy your time at SMU! It was the best time of my life tbh.

(If it helps, I did my bachelors in Accountancy)"
Bbyys,1,Why u wan maintain 3.4 by S1 doh
Koufas,3,"It really depends on what your interests are. I'd suggest thinking about what kind of careers you are interested in or what kind of work you think suits you before choosing a second major. There is no ""best"" second major - there is only a second major that is fit for you

Some of the more popular ones other than Finance include DSA or Quant. But there are plenty of Econs students planning to go into Marketing doing that as their second major too, for example

_wabisabi-,12,"Another Y1 here, Im kinda in the same boat as you, Im not very good at making friends. I think in uni compared to JC/sec sch you spends way less time in common with everyone else and so it kind of tougher to make friends here. But i think not going to CCAs is kind of a mistake cuz for me personally I made most of my currents friends in CCAs. I know that you want to focus on ur studies but why not go for lower commitment CCAs or go for events based CCA once in while?

AmbassadorLoud2073,5,"Y1 student here too. Most of my classes I also entered the room on the first day alone, but as the class is full someone essentially had to sit next to me/in my “group table” and hence they became my buddies for that particular module 🤣

Burbursur,6,"Year 4 here. After 4 years I am still not used to class parting. I get anxious everytime I wanna cp and repeat what I wanna say again and again and again in my head before actually saying it. Sometimes by the time I decide to raise my hand, someone would have already said what I wanted to say so I dont cp a whole lot too.

Having that said, I wouldnt worry too much (grades wise). Some modules count class part through the elearn discussion forum as well and its possible to attain full cp marks without even opening your mouth hahaha. You can still attain stellar grades without speaking in class (depending on the mod).

So overall, over the course of your uni life, I would say that not verbally speaking in class does affect your grades but its not nearly significant enough to justify you worrying about it.

Dont worry too much and atb in your Uni life!!!"
WalkAlive9557,3,Same issue here. I guess it really depends on the percentage of class participation mark
AmbassadorLoud2073,3,"Similar issue here, especially in my bidded classes where seniors class part at every chance they get. For some of my modules my profs gave us a class part rubric to follow, and as long as we do assignments or attempt to contribute to team discussion(during group work), it counts as class part. Heck, i even have a module where my prof asks every single person a question, to help us gain cp marks. 

But for some classes, not a very good method, but I usually wait a few seconds to see if anyone answers the profs qns, and if no one answers I’ll try to give my points. This method isn’t the best as you can tell, in classes where there are cp snipers I’ll defo lose out. Otherwise when the prof allows us to pose questions/opinions on the telegram chat/padlet/slack etc, I’ll take full advantage of those XD"
Prestigious_Nail_279,2,"I’m a freshie too, and I’d say if you have something outside of the scope to mention or an opinion you’d like to share I’d say just step out of your comfort zone and share it

I recently presented my thoughts in class for a question posed and was low key embarrassed because I got the essence of the question wrong, but when I looked around and observed I think no one really cares, everyone’s there trying to learn and grow together! 

Likewise for yourself, I think sharing your unfiltered thoughts (albeit be a tad wary.. cause “unfiltered”) with the class can sometimes proof to value add in discussions, or what the prof is sharing."

Frankly, no you shouldn't, especially not under peer pressure.

In all honesty, most people won't stay with the same clique (or even stay friends) throughout their four years in SMU. Depending on whether you bid with them in subsequent semesters and the size of your cohort, you may NEVER see them again.

Ultimately, you need to make the decision yourself.

Soon-to-be-forgotten,6,"Not sure which school you're in but SCIS' instructors can be really important.

Usually, the loaned amount would be automatically deducted from the fees but it may take some time to reflect that."
Koufas,3,"Am not exactly an Econs student but I take quite a number of Econs modules

I think that it is very easy to forget that ultimately, Econs is a technical degree, and Econometrics is the basis of technical analysis in econs. There is no escaping from the basic math-related modules. That being said, I think that Math for Econs is the onlybasic one that is super ""math""-heavy, while Statistical Theory and Econometrics are more stats-related which is slightly different from pure Math.

I think in more advanced Econs mods, you will not strictly speaking need to know everything in Math for Econs to an A-standard, but if you do more advanced technical analysis like, say, Forecasting or Time Series you might need to understand certain math concepts (eg Matrix) to understand more advanced techniques well (eg Structural VARs)

Most of the ""math"" is less of math and more of algebra/statistics. In practice, there are many pieces of software that can help us do the math and we don't need to calculate everything by hand (like R, Stata, EViews, SPSS, even Excel...) but we need to know the math/stats behind it before we can apply these things effectively. So youll be using more stats than math strictly speaking

Most modules however are non-technical in nature, but they do require math. However, I will say that most of this math in non-technical mods are more for expressing logic and how things work in a quantifiable way. For example, it is easy to say that growth includes productivity. But how do we express this in a way that is consistent, measurable, and workable? An equation is probably a convenient way to do so

Econs in SMU is not ALL math - tbh compared to my friends in NUS and NTU there is more of a focus of learning how to apply the math through projects (eg reading Bernanke's biography and presenting on how equations can apply or be changed according to his description of the GFC) rather than strictly speaking math alone

I would say that Im not naturally inclined towards math either but im making an effort to do better and be better at it. We can chat in PM if you want, but just because youre not naturally good at math doesnt mean you cant do Econs"
btkh95,1,"Please elaborate why Economics piqued your interest and what are the modules that you currently enjoy?

I would say you really do need some math and statistics as well. SMU SOE also tend to be more exam based than other schools and you kind of need to memorise formulas and stuff.

Just grad this year too. Can drop a DM if you like too."
Koufas,0,"There is no bellcurve in SMU

If you look at the typical grade statiatics for each mod however you will notice that the number of As always hover around the 30-35% mark with the exception of SMU-X Modules"
Koufas,2,"Yes Major Cores cannot be pass/fail

People clear both uni core and electives overseas, depends which is easier for them

People also go with friends or alone depending on their preference. Not set way to go about doing it, just do what you prefer"
existencezxc,2,"I cleared asian studies (ironic as i did my exchange in europe), globalisation and accounting electives (cos i didn't want to do them and fret over them in SMU. Hahaha. Rather get a pass/fail for those) 

It's harder to clear major core overseas because SMU probably wants you to do them here. I don't remember anyone from Accounting clearing their core mods on exchange. 

I went for exchange with a close friend (i.e., someone who I have travelled with before and would stay at each other's houses on a whim), so exchange just felt like an extended trip. 

The thing about travelling with friends is that there are bound to be conflicts and i've heard far too many horror stories about those who fall out after exchange. If you'd like to go on exchange with a friend, choose one wisely! Make sure you can comfortably live/interact with this person for a couple of months. 

If you are the kind who can mix well with others and don't mind making friends, then it's great to travel alone too as it'll be more flexible that way."

Rapadooz,1,"1. You’ll get 12 exemptions from SMU as long as you do the correct modules and electives. Exam fees for the remaining three are not subsidised and you’ll have to pay full price. Membership fees for ICAEW are waived for four years as long as you have a valid school email address. The price for each exam is about £103 pounds the last I checked. 

2. As mentioned above, membership fees are waived if you’re a current SMU student. For prospective students, you can try to show them ur offer letter and maybe they’ll waive your membership fees. Not so sure about that. 

3. It would be kind of a waste if you start studying for ICAEW certificate or professional papers because eventually you’ll be studying them in SMU and taking their papers. So it’s kind of a double work.

Koufas,10,"Ultimately, what decides your entrance into a bank-related internship is more of your skillsets (or your network, but there is little point in having a network if you dont have skills) than your CV/resume. They usually have structured and rigorous interview processes. At least when I interviewed for an internship, it was 80% technical questions and 20% personal questions. Very little about my CCAs

The pre-filtering process before your interview is also likely to be a games-based assessment rather than someone screening your resume or CV so prestige really matters much less than before unless you know someone personally la

If you join a finance CCA, you'd still have to work hard to keep your spot + learn the skills that the CCA wants to teach you. You could join more than one, but it is usually extremely difficult to keep up if you do both in the same sem because most of these CCAs have quite intensive training programmes

The network these CCAs offer you is very useful. Extremely useful. I'd recommend joining an acad CCA just because of the network + sharing of experiences alone. Really helps a lot compared to if you go into applications blind

Bear in mind that beyond the different banks, within a bank itself there are also different roles depending on what you are interested in. While most of the fin CCAs have networks that expand across various roles within the banking sector, it could also be helpful to think about which roles you are interested in the most

For a Y1, I think it would be most helpful to go into a fin CCA or a career dialogue to just learn more about banking and the different roles/skillsets required in the space rather than thinking about securing your career right now. I would also recommend you attend the Info sessions of the various fin CCAs or speak to seniors inside the CCAs to understand the commitment needed for each of them, as well as what they offer."

Koufas,24,"Dont need buy coffee cans la or bottles la. Just buy coffee from one of the many stores nearby - much better than canned or bottled coffee and usually better value price-wise

For reference, here is a list of coffee places and their prices for kopi nearby SMU. Do support them if you can to keep them going

1. Huggs - $3.90
2. ~~Ya Kun - $3.50 for large now. Used to be $3.35 but increase alr. Small I think is now \~ $2.50~~
3. Koufu\* \~ $2.00
4. Onalu\* \~ $3.50
5. Starbucks at Lazada Building and at SMU B1
6. Behind Waterloo - $1.70
7. Food Dynasty - $2.40
8. Coffeebot (Hot Coffee) - $2.00 to $3.20 depending on which coffee you get
9. Korean Place near Bricklane\* \~ $2.50
10. Providence - $1.70+ depending on which coffee you get. Iced is slightly more. But they are usually not open so early in the morning
11. Toast Box closer to the printing shops - $2.50+?

\* I rarely buy coffee from these stores so I am not 100% sure if these are their prices/still their prices

Coffeebot only sells hot coffee. Available at SOB and SOL for a quick fix during a break or if you're running late

I personally buy kopi from Ya Kun, Food Dynasty, Providence and Huggs depending on what I feel like

Food Dynasty as its the most money-for-value while taking into account distance and taste and if I am feeling like a normal iced kopi.

Providence provides the best hot black coffee imo. Their wraps are also slept on for a quick bite. Essentially Happy Days cafe 2.0 so if I am feeling a muffin or a quick bite I will go there

Huggs is imo the best quality iced kopi around school but its a bit ex. Other Huggs chains sell iced kopi for $3.50 so I would usually not make this a regular buy. Their food is really good though

If you drink a lot of coffee, Ya Kun Large is the best one. I usually get this in the morning and it lasts me throughout the day. But I drink more coffee than most people la. I think most people if they buy Ya Kun Large they cannot finish though. The Ya Kun aunties also recently retired so big sad

Behind waterloo is the cheapest iced kopi near school but its a bit of a walk, will only get this if I'm eating there anyway

If you have lunch at Plaza Sing and want to buy iced kopi before class, B2 has a really good iced kopi place for $1.70. Forgot the store's name but they sell noodles and it is nearby the vegetarian wrap store which is closer to the MRT side

If Open Kitchen opens again at Connexion they sell iced kopi as well"

for your first concern, i personally wldnt recommend doing 2 math mods in one sem bc the content might be overwhelming and it’ll mean you’ll have 2 finals which are math heavy. plus u mentioned that u don’t have any math bg so imo it’s best to not to.

taking stats in y1 is recommended but NOT a must. i myself am i y2 and will be taking it this cmng sem so it’s rly uty and the circumstances. 

as for taking 5 mods in ur first sem, since ur in Basket A (which is considered the lighter basket), it wld mean you’ll only hve 3 finals to prep for which is considered the avg. taking stats and calc next sem wld mean u hve 5 finals to prep which is highly not recommended due to the amt of content u hve to study. 

Basket B (intro to psych, und societies, SEA) is content heavy and has a heavier workload. imo u shldnt take stats next sem if ur planning to take calc as well.


for your second concern, stats is a compulsory core mod so u can’t replace it by taking calculus. since u aren’t exempted frm calculus, u stl need to take both mods to clear ur grad requirements. 

hope this helped :)"

I don’t recommend going into 5 mods right away since you don’t feel confident about the workload. 

I’ve heard good things about Raymond but he’s very expensive. You might consider doing under another Prof and working with a student tutor since stats needs practice (don’t take my word for it though. I didn’t do well but I didn’t practice either :p). If you plan to major in psych, I heard it gets expensive so you should be prudent with the e$. Hoping for corroboration from psych students though.

cracked_buns,3,"LTB/BGS cannot double count towards biz in context if you're choosing to use if for management basket.

Workload wise, here's a breakdown of the mods:

- LTB is extremely project heavy. It trades off cramming for a finals with a heavier workload during the semester. The projects standards for LTB has been going up in the last few years so prepare to put in some elbow grease to get a good score. To top it off, you don't have control over your groupings, so it's a risk on how much work you have to do. However the mod itself doesn't have much homework or need to mug other than the mid terms and whatever u need for the finals.

- BGS is more a consistent reading and studying mod. It has content you need to study for finals but it's usually related to things you already know like current affairs. Diff profs will have different content and the workload can vary but BGS is known to be quite a chill mod. Having writing skills is a plus. 

All in all, pick the mod that fits your working style. Figure out if you like finals or prefer projects. Understanding yourself and what kind of study environment you do well in and you'll be fine."

LeSirPotatoes,1,"Climate change tends to have disproportionately more y3s and y4s as it’s a pretty expensive mod, and I found the grading a little strict."
Koufas,14,"SMU-X classes are quite varied in nature as each Prof has their own style of doing things. They might also have different networks, meaning they will ask different partners which will give a different scope of work every year. So i think its quite Prof-dependent rather than SMU-X as a whole. I would only take the SMU-X classes I took if you're interested in them + enjoys more application based learning (eg trying to work with a client on an irl problem rather than keeping the learning in class)

That being said, I am taking my third SMU-X mod next sem in a 5 mod sem. I personally find it much more meaningful to bid for SMU-X mods as your work has actual impact, and you get to work with a client. In some cases, it is almost like youre a part-time intern because you have to go down every week to finish the project (eg sensitive data). In other cases you collect data yourself before processing them

For Ms Ching's class specifically, it is designed with the assumption that Y1s/Y2s will take the module in mind. It is a steeper learning curve than other Y1 modules as you will need to watch videos + try out calcs in Excel for yourself, but I found it a great way to start off uni life

She makes her lessons very engaging, for example by bringing different roulettes to class for us to learn probability. Or she will buy nutella + bread and ask you to spread it before dropping it on the floor. She might also buy the whole class Subway. And make tea in cups. And do random experiments that have to do with probability.

Out of all the stats Profs I think she definitely has the most memorable lessons. No other Prof would go to such lengths to make Stats really come alive and help you to see its practical applications - especially in Y1.

Her assignments are also a great way to get used to uni life. Not only is every question based on something that had actually happened irl (which reinforces how stats can be essential), but she also gives the class 10-15 questions every week.

The week after, she will only go through questions that students have tried to solve and present first. If the class decides to work together, split the work, and if all 15 questions are done by different people, she will go through all 15 questions (or reaffirm if the presenters explanation was accurate). If your class decides to not do it, then your class wont benefit. You reap what you sow.

This also means that there are a LOT of opportunities to class part as an hour is allocated for students to go through assignment qns at the front. It also means that you can get the chance to practice presenting every week and gain confidence while doing so. 

Thanks to being in her class, I felt much more equipped to handle my second SMU-X module as I already had some experience working with actual data and stats in Excel. Even the Econs students who have already taken econometrics were less comfortable than I was in taking a shot at building a model and handing the data despite myself not touching econometrics at all. I also think that eventually there will be some need to understand stats for every role.

Traditionally, you will also go door-to-door or person-to-person to gather data for the mod. Not sure if it will happen due to COVID but it was a good experience too.

Finals were also focussed on fundamentals rather than trying to trip you up, which means if you study solidly youll do well. You also have opportunities to score higher than the cap of the class part component by volunteering more. 

However, there are trade-offs. SMU-X classes require a lot of time investment if you want to do well, and Ms Ching's class is no different. You also need to work as a group, and if there are members that disappear, it is really more difficult to answer the assignment questions. And as new Y1s, communication/groupwork is not exactly everyone's forte, so expect to work with people who are not the best groupmates. You might even find yourself not being the best groupmate either. Definitely wasn't always smooth sailing - needed a lot of work and communication.

You really reap what you sow. Don't take the mod if you are only looking to cruise through; only take the mod if you are genuinely looking to learn, experience more, and do your best - and have the bandwidth.

Overall I think Ms Ching's class is a really good way to step up to the plate and learn more about what it means to be independent + uni life. You may struggle - but in life, we all will. If you don't have the capacity to do it however, please put yourself first.

It is an experience I doubt anyone who takes her class seriously would forget. You can look up her Youtube Channel yourself to see the Finale her students put together at the end of every sem for the client (you have to present the data after all).

This was my batch's: https://youtu.be/PGFumj3U_jw

She also got Rick Astley to record a video for us too

So yes - I think for Ms Ching's class specifically. Do it - if you are genuine about learning more about the subject in an applied manner and have the capacity to do so and are willing to put in the effort. If not. Avoid the class.

If you are just looking for a cut and dry class, avoid her class. But if you are looking to commit to an experience, then yes do it.

I think the workload is manageable as long as you are disciplined about it. Definitely higher workload than non SMU-X Modules. I won't lie and say that I wasn't challenged; I was. But I really enjoyed the challenge. But it also isn't for everyone.

Don't spend too long; set a deadline and move on after. My second SMU-X mod was also during a 5-mod sem. I think its a good step closer to the realities of the working world if you choose to try.

Grades-wise. Well, project has a higher weightage as its heavier than the norm. But I think that that is compensated through how easy it is to score class part (if you try) and the non-complex finals. 

My group didnt do super well because we split the project into parts and let 1 person oversee their questions. Tbh I feel like this has its trade-offs because it meant the rest of us chose to not pay attention to questions outside our purview. But class part + finals made up for it imo.

If you take her class, she might be particular about a few things too

1. Calling her Ms Ching, not Prof
2. Saying hi to her every morning
3. Apologising if you are late

I think at the end of the day. Like all other mods. Be selective about it and know yourself best - including what you like, what you can handle, and what you are interested in. If you're not interested in how the mod is like then don't bid for it.

Not all SMU-X modules are like this either - other mods you might even have to find the client yourself. 

Hope it helps."

synrg18,3,"Y4 here. I did LTB in my first sem.

LTB is project based. You’ll be partnered with an external organisation to craft a proposal. Can be pretty hit or miss depending on what org you get and how good your group is. I had a fine experience because my group was okay but I’ve had friends who didn’t have good experiences. Kind of depends on what you expect (don’t expect good communication). If you really expect to make a difference with your project then you might be frustrated by it. 

Cons aside, the mod isn’t too hard. Study content isn’t a lot; mostly fluff and the assessments are just study the textbook and some reflection, plus presentations ofc. Expect a lot of those, but if you’re good at that then it’ll be good for you. The project can be a good experience in developing some skills too even if your group sucks, but that does mean more effort from you.

TL;DR easy-ish mod, but mileage may vary with your luck

I didn’t do CC, so no input there."
Soon-to-be-forgotten,6,"1. Yes. But there's some sort of reverse psychology at play sometimes. If everyone thinks 8am classes are easier to get or cheaper, then everyone bids for those classes, which may result in afternoon sections actually having less students. Still, generally yes.

2. Personally, both are common. I think cliques are more common if it's a core module but less common if it's an elective, track, major or basket modules.

3. Looking at your flair (IS), IS students tend to have a second major from SCIS too. It's definitely less common compared to, I imagined, other schools. But don't let that deters you from pursuing your interests, even if it doesn't necessarily or immediately match your degree major."

DeviousComet465,1,"If you are still waiting for it, I just want to let you know, your chances are very low now"
Koufas,2,"Hello. Congratulations on matriculating. Good luck on your DDP - looks challenging

I think the main reason why its > 54CUs compared to the other DDPs is because CS students only have to clear 6 SMU Core CUs, while other students have to clear 12

For example, CS students only have to clear Numeracy and Internship under Capabilities but the rest of us have to take 6 CUs under there

I'll try to ask around, but CS is still quite new so am not sure if there even is a CS/BBM DDP senior tbvh

In the meantime, I think these will be the answers you are looking for - although I am not a DDP nor CS nor BBM student myself 

>Are the Internship and Community Service mods double counted?

Double counting usually refers to using one module to clear two different baskets/requirements across our first degree and second major/degree. In this case, Internship and Comm Service are two separate requirements that we cannot use the same experience to finish. So no they cannot be double counted

However, if you are asking if you would have to do two Internships and two Comm Service activities to finish your DDP. The CS booklet seems to be a bit unclear about it, but the BBM booklet says that you don't have to re-clear all your SMU Core modules. You only have to take the BBM course + the CS Major + Electives. From what I know of DDP as well, you also only have to clear 12 CUs from SMU Cores once for your first degree. So I think its quite unlikely you'll have to do these things two times

>I was exempted from 3 Free Electives. For CS, I have to take 6 FE and Biz I have to take 7 FEs. Does this mean I only have to take 4 FEs?

If you are doing a DDP (or second major) your Free Electives will be double counted with pretty much all the other modules in your other degree so no worries there - just look at the compulsory mods for both degrees first and the FEs will be filled up. You'll only need to worry about it if you choose to not take up a DDP or a second major

>CS Handbook says it is required... So where did my counting of CUs go wrong?

If you have not declared your track yet, I think BOSS doesn't list Track Electives as requirements yet as you have technically not signed up for a particular track yet. It should appear after the declaration

I glanced through the modules of both CS and BBM and I didn't see any overlaps in the Major Cores and Major Electives, unless you choose to specialise in some of the tracks eg Marketing/Fin Analytics which has Data Management - which overlaps with CS Core. But that's already going into tracks outside of the basic requirements

So, I suspect that when referring to double-counting. Other than the 6 Free Electives. It refers to double-counting the SMU Core Curriculum under Degree 1, with SMU Core Curriculum under Degree 2 (double counting towards the same Core Curriculum requirement is different from double counting in Core Curriculum + Major Elective for example)

The repeats seem to be 1 from Internship, 1 from EnS/Tech/Cultures, 1 from Comm Service, 1 from Ethics and 1 from Big Questions. So that makes 5. The doc says that the additional mods youll have to take under SMU Core are basically baskets from which courses have not been taken for CS so it probably excludes the SMU Core that you took for CS already

So overall that its likely to be...

36 (CS) + 11 (BBM Core) + 6 (Major Core) + 12 (SMU Core) - 6 (FE) - 5 (Core overlaps) = 54 CUs

If you have not declared it in BOSS it should not appear

>So I have to take 54-62 CUs. How can I spread them out in 4/5 years? I heard that maximum mods one can take is 5? And even in 10 semesters I can only clear 50 CUs. Can I overload it to 6 per sem?

Yes you can overload it to 6 per sem, but you will need to write in to do so. It is also not easy at all

You can also take Summer classes in Term 3A and 3B; its something that some of my DDP friends have done. You can take 2 modules per Summer semester, mostly SMU Core modules. The only thing is that it is an additional sem outside of the usual subsidised amount so you will incur some more $$

Taking 10 sems for DDP is also not uncommon"

Mamemoo123,4,"If ure fresh out of NS and havent been using ur brains then 4 finals might be tough for u.

Personally, i only took 4 mods and had 3 finals. (Fa, blaw, da and ctrw) and i managed to cope well, probably wouldve died if i did 4 finals ngl.

The general rule of thumb is to always balance out your quanti and quali mods and gauge how ""heavy"" each mod is to u."

General norm is Ask and Ye Shall Receive

Honestly I dont think that many people ask around for notes other than in SOL (for pre-writes) or content-heavy social science mods such as Politics of SEA (where your readings for the first lesson is the first half of the textbook, and the second lesson is the second half lol)

But yes just ask politely in ask.smu or ask your seniors and Im sure people are willing to help"
No_Bumblebee5112,1,T.me/sumocumlaude
Koufas,7,"1. Read your Course Handbook to understand what modules you need to take to graduate (Google: SMU SOSS Handbook). Read all of it that is relevant to you - especially the last two pages 

Reading the handbook will usually resolve half the questions  we have on which courses to take, how your degree programme works and what options there are available. A lot of details inside

2. Bid for compulsory courses first to give you more time to decide what electives you should take in your later years. Courses under Core Curriculum and then Major Core are always a safe bet.

If you mean specific suggestions, I would suggest clearing Intro Stats in your first year as that is in every Major Core for PPS. 

You have your preassigneds to clear too so you don't have to bid for 4-5 courses every sem. Don't need to stress too much in the first Year thankfully

If you still cannot decide what to bid for, Oasis should have some information or a recommended bidding schedule for you.

3. Make sure when you bid, no two classes have exams during the same timing. Also don't bid for more than 4 exams a semester. Imo the ideal is 3 but 4 is fine too.

If you want to plan out further and connect with a Psych/PolSci senior for planning out your degree, drop me a DM and I can connect you to someone."
Koufas,4,"Have you taken a look at the Course Outlines of all the modules in the different baskets? 

Maybe you can elaborate on what your interests are and why you are facing difficulties choosing between which modules in which baskets?

Otherwise it seems like you are asking us to plan out your degree wholesale based on our own preferences which I don't think is very helpful to you. For example I took MC and BGS and enjoyed both thoroughly but there are many in SMU who would strongly discourage everyone from taking these modules. But I really enjoyed them.

Just have to figure out what your interests are or what you think you'll benefit most from.

General advice-wise. I don't recommend taking Spreadsheet in Y1 unless you have some prior experience and are very familiar with Excel.

MC has a Pitch component so some students prefer to bid for it in Year 3/4 after they have some confidence in presenting. Tbh in Econs you won't be presenting as much compared to say Law or Social Science students so its not a bad idea to get more practice in IMO."

- Got into SOB in Y1
- Took up a SOB/SOL DDP at the end of Y1
- Dropped his SOB degrer
- Finished his SOL degree by Y4

So essentially a 3 year programme but he still spent 4 years in uni.

I would not suggest taking this route without good reason. He had to take 6 mods per sem and according to him had no life. Law students already struggle with a 4 mod sem due to content. I cant imagine taking Constitutional Law with 4 other mods and fully doing the mod justice unless you have prior knowledge

Any particular reason why you want to finish in 3 years?"
Koufas,4,"In reality, there is not a stark difference in curriculum. Sure SMU Econs is known for being relatively less theory-heavy but its not like it is materially different to a significant degree

I think it would be good to figure out what you want from a uni and then make your decision. Most people who go to SMU for example were quite intentional in their choice rather than riding on conventional wisdom or what others might have said about the school

For example if you value residential life, NTU would be a better fit. If you enjoy a city-campus vibe, SMU is a better fit. Lecture-tutorials? NTU. Seminar style? SMU. 

The major differences between NTU and SMU generally lie in fit and focus rather than standards. So it would be good to figure out yours and decide based on that

I am not close to my FO friends at all. I think I had one close friend coming out of FO but we stopped talking after a few months 

I am very close to a few of my OGmates from my faculty camp, though. But I am also really close to some of my batchmates as we have shared multiple classes together and bid together

There are plenty of opportunities to put yourself out there and make friends in SMU, but it largely depends on you putting in the effort

You can drop me a PM if you want and I can bring you/intro you to some of the CCAs that I am in

SMU Toastmasters would be my recommendation for freshies looking to make friends and get to know people in a low-pressure atmosphere. Low-pressure, welcoming, learning environment. You also get to hear people make speeches about their own lives, so its really easy to get to know more about people. People always think Toastmasters is just about giving speeches etc which it is but its one of the most supportive communities I have encoutered in a long time. And since most speeches are based on the lives of the speaker themselves, it is an easy way to get to know people and learn how to be vulnerable with otehrs too. Great way to make friends as well.

Koufas,38,"I'm an introvert going into Y4 next semester. You can take my words with a pinch of salt, but I just wanted to share my own experience struggling with similar thoughts

  
I used to be someone who was solely focussed on getting good academic results, developing my portfolio, and thinking that I didn't really need people. Honestly, I thought of myself as ""better"" than most. But I realised that I was trying to justify my poor social skills, low self-esteem, and lack of effort at socialisation through the pursuit of other more ""worthy"" goals

As someone who spends less than half his time in school, university can be so much more than just a piece of paper - if you choose to do treat it as such. You really do reap what you sow

If you choose to focus on your academics and that is all you go to school for, that is the only thing you will get out of it

If you choose to put in effort at reaching out, making friends, and building social capital, you will likely graduate with a network that you are able to learn from, and most importantly, a social support system to tide you through tough times both during and after uni. I frequently have 5-10 minute chats with peers pursuing industries because I run into a question that they can answer, and its so much simpler to just ask them instead of spending 1 hour figuring out the answer on my own

If you choose to put in effort into learning how to work with people you completely disagree with, learning how to carry groups that don't pull their weight at all, and learning how to find the good in people instead of judging based off first impressions, it is very likely you will graduate a better leader, and a better person

If you choose to build relationships, people would want to rally around you too

You can go ahead and mug + ciao everyday if that is truly the only thing that would give you meaning throughout these \~4 years. But honestly I think that, for the vast majority of us, thriving in the corporate world requires skills like managing expectations laterally, building rapport with clients, and having a give-and-take relationship with the people around you. You can build this by trying to interact with people

I think that whenever we are in a scenario, we need to try and learn from it. If there is nothing to learn, we either set new goals for ourselves, or leave if it is not worth it

It is completely fine to go to school just to get that cert, SMU really has so many things to offer other than acads. In fact, I would say that SMU's selling point compared to other local Us are actually the non-acads

Last semester I took quite a bit of Y2 modules even though I was in Y3 because of my course. I chose to challenge myself by trying to help as my juniors as I can, and learn new ways of tackling modules with groupmates by leading them instead of disparaging them

Not saying that there will never be instances whereby its better to just withdraw. But I think that for the most part, there is still value to be gained in whatever we do. Its just a matter of evaluating the value of that value

You can choose to ignore all of the non-curriculum aspects of school if you'd like. But if you have the energy, capacity, and opportunity to engage in them, would suggest you give it a shot. There are people who would like to do all of these things, but for various reasons, are unable to. As for going for orientation or not - I think its fine to give it a miss if you don't want to go. But given that the cost is not that much, would also suggest just going for it and if you don't like it just don't turn up for the remainder of the camp"

throwawayDontLitter7,4,"nope. you actually save time tbh , i would not go if i could turn back time"
synrg18,2,"No, you don’t. But you might make some friends/connections and that’s valuable. 

I went, made a good friend out of it but otherwise gained little else. Take that as you will. There are a lot of opportunities to meet people which you absolutely should take at one point or another. Not everything is about your academics! In fact, a lot of things in uni will be more valuable than just your acads."

Rihah_Adriana,1,I’m also considering for run 2. Would like to know if this session is helpful? What will they be covering on? Thanks!
usoppsbutt,1,"hi! i went for run 1 of the headstart programme\^\^

honestly, the content taught wasn't the most useful to me... on day 1, we went through some activities/games related to our goals and values in life. day 2 was sharing from y2s & library search stuff (the one you did for e-learn. they re-iterated what was already learnt on the online course... just with activities + a librarian facilitating it). the programme takes up nearly the entire day. good thing was that we got released 1-2 hours earlier than what was stated in the email (6pm i think). 

ok even though the content wasn't the most beneficial, i'm actually glad i went for it. 

why?

1. each group had a senior faci on day 1 (most likely a scholar because mine was). you can get really good tips & insights from these seniors. v worth it. 
2. everyone gets a free $10 starbucks card on day 1!!! (not confirmed if your run will get or not)
3. get to meet a lot of people from different faculties so it was funnn"
babyfuse,8,"No, but it depends on individual character and the group dynamic. Nonetheless, there are certain insightful things which your ogls will share, such as matters regarding bidding, CCAs, ins and outs of the school...etc. 

I attended orientation not with the goal of networking but to have a better understanding of how the average SMU student life is like

Edit: Given that you did mention that it's a faculty orientation, it is a good chance to know at least some people. This could ease you into classes where you might know a person or two to sit with"
Koufas,3,"Yes. My closest friends in SMU are those I went orientation with for my faci camp. One of the best decisions I made. I even went to work half-way but came back a few hours later

I would also bid with them when I could

Icebreaker games are more to help those who really face difficulties opening up on their own during a social setting. Even if you dont like them, there might be someone in the group who needs them/use them. Even if you dont need them, would suggest considering how it might help others if more people participate

Ultimately if you are open to trying new things, making friends and being genuinely you, I think naturally you will see like-minded people being around you regardless of the circumstance. This is just another opportunity to potentially surround yourself with like-minded people. Up to you if you want this opportunity or not. But I think you should sign-up honestly.

Soon-to-be-forgotten,1,"Not a SOSS student but I believe many Psychology students take up a second major from SOB. If so, they usually just take up jobs aligned with their second majors.

There are of course also some Psychology students who chose a second major from SOSS, especially if they plan to enter academia, private practice or public service. 


Maybe there are some modules here and there, but SMU doesn't have a specific roadmap for Criminal Psychology I think.

I don't know whether it would be suitable but Legal Studies from SOL seems like it would be useful for the discipline."
Koufas,1,"Yeah I don't know anyone doing Psych + PPPM together, but I know another commenter on this sub takes PPPM

Not many Psych students end up going into Psych immediately because it usually requires a Masters

If you want to find out about all the different second majors you can read more about them on the SMU websites. The handbook would also allow you to see which courses fall under which second majors so you would be better able to make a decision"

shitama,6,"Hi, I happen to be an international student under accountancy who got offered a scholarship from SMU as well. You can DM me for any extra information.

From my experience, to even get considered for the scholarship interview, you need good grades. Since I took IB, that’ll around a grade of 42-43 above. You’ll also want good extracurricular activities in order to stand out amongst others.

The next best thing is to do well in the interview. Make sure you articulate your points properly, and try to learn about SMU more before doing it. (SMU’s interactive pedagogy and whatnot.) I still have the list of questions they asked me for the interview, you can dm me for them if you want.

Additionally, I think there will be greater chances if you happen to be from an ASEAN country and take a more “general” curriculum like IB and A-Levels. Not saying the chances are 0 if you’re not, but it’s typically more rare."

jayleebean_,2,"Hi, maybe you can try getting housing on campus (in the city area) which is most convenient for international students like yourself especially since you only need the housing for one semester,,,drawback is that it might be a little pricey.

Otherwise, you may try to rent a room in HDBs which are the cheapest accommodation options imo. 30-45min travelling time should bring you safely outside the city centre where rent is not as expensive. This amount of travelling time is also not that bad honestly and it's quite common for local students too, including myself. Would recommend this as you'll get to explore more areas of Singapore and truly immerse yourself into the local culture by living like a local.

As for 2., I'd suggest being wary of sharing a room with a stranger if its a particularly longer contract, unless you are staying in PSR or a hostel where recourse is slightly easier

OnlyATadBitConfused,2,"finding a cheap single room around SMU would be a bit difficult but you could try searching through 99.co, propertyguru, etc.

i could give you some suggestions to get a “cheaper” place:

- try expanding your search! 30mins away isn’t too bad esp if you choose a location with a direct bus/train to school. 

- rent a whole condo with other intl students so you can divide the cost together. there are security guards and facilities (e.g., pool & gym) available! (but staying in an hdb even without “security” is still pretty safe imo)


good luck finding a place to stay !!"
trashmoney4,1,dude I'm in the same situation!! I'm an international student too and i got rejected and waitlisted today and it's really not fair because i got my offer super late. currently digging around in the list of alternative places they sent trying to find something halfway decent that doesn't have an unnecessarily long commute. i wrote an appeal email so hopefully that works out :(

Beneficial_Olive_151,1,Hey guys! How do we go about applying to PSR? I have no idea 😅
lostinliife,8,Your sanity.
Tight_Stop_3522,1,following!
agavege_,1,"• not that it would be hard to live far from uni, it's just that travel time could've been time spent doing something else. public transpo goes a long way in sg so find a place that would not take more than 30 mins by bus or train if you want somewhere that's cheaper (thats my personal preference)

• i didn't stay in PSR or yoha, so I looked to rent a room somwhere else with the help of a family friend. factors: location (again, check how long it will take to and from school + how far is it from the nearest mrt station/bus stop), what do you want to rent (a whole apartment, just a room, etc.), type (HDB, condominum, etc. rent for rooms in condominiums will generally be more expensive), type of room (will you be sharing with someone else in a room or do you want a room to yourself), bathroom (will u be sharing the bathroom with someone else or will you have your own), cooking (do you plan to cook at your place? some places will only allow 'light cooking'), landlord (will the landlord be staying with you? others prefer to not stay with them because they can be overbearing or strict, but i personally don't mind), rent price (does it include utilities and other expenses?) 

• regarding on having to be in sg, it depends on the landlords as well, because in my experience the first place i rented was all right with me using my IPA letter before I got my student pass provided i sent him a copy as soon as I got it. My other friend though, the landlord did not allow her to rent until she got hers, so she stayed in a budget hotel first for almost a month. So make sure to bring this up with the landlord/agent upfront as well. It would also be best to be in SG so you can check the place you would consider and ask the landlady/agent yourself the questions you have. 

let me know if u have other questions!"
OnlyATadBitConfused,1,"1. I don’t live in one, but I did look into them before. Tbh, the prices are a bit higher than they should be but then again they are “serviced” as in someone comes by to clean every week or so (depends on the hostel/co-living space), but I remember some places including your utilities in the rent fee already and not a separate payment (so that’s good because you can turn your AC on when it’s hot w/o worrying about your ⚡️ bill) — IMO the locations aren’t too bad, just choose one with a bus/mrt nearby.

2. I don’t think it’s hard. Living somewhere not walking distance to uni allows you to explore the country more! Plus SMU has a lot of accessible bus stops and mrt lines, so commuting is not a big problem. Just don’t live more than 40 minutes away from uni since I (personally) think that is too much time wasted.

3. Something I regret is choosing a place without an mrt station nearby. Where I live does have a bus directly going to SMU but on other days wherein I want to go elsewhere, I usually take bus then mrt. The transferring is not too big of an issue, but it would be nice to have both a bus and mrt station nearby :)"
Hackzx_,4,">How's the workload like for IS105 - Business Data Management?

Took it a year ago and I think the workload was pretty okay.

It consists of in class quizzes, project, mid terms and finals.

Content wise it was pretty manageable too. If you're an accounting student, some of the content in IS105 overlaps with the accounting information systems module that you would have taken earlier as well, especially topics about database design. So it should be pretty manageable."

DonutGambit,3,"Drove so can’t comment on motorcycles so might not be the most applicable to you:

1. Not hard to find space. The carpark is pretty big actually since it extends to SOA. From experience it’s more crowded in the mid to later part of the semester though so might get trickier.

2. For motorcycles it might be worth it since it’s a lot cheaper than for cars. You can check out the alternative locations nearby for better rates like Fort Canning or NTUC Income. I’m not too familiar with the motorbike rates.

3. The staff parking area is demarcated. The rest of it is all up for grabs."

Koufas,11,"Better if you don't like pure theory. I think if you want to grow. You should def go SMU.

Although if you are at a stage of choosing between two schools, asking Reddit a vague, general question is not a good way to get a slot in a school that fits you best.

I'd suggest making a list of what is important to you in uni (eg leads to higher pay, campus life, food choices, career-focussed culture, practical curriculum, career-focussed CCA... List is endless).

Then looking at all your offers and seeing which school has to see which has things that are more important.

To start ofd off you can Google ""SMU Econs Handbook"" and read the course curriculum to know more about it. Do the same for your other offers.

I will say that there is so much more to SMU than your curriculum. Because everyone who chooses SMU generally are people who have done their research and care about other things instead of Qs scores, academia or what other people say about your school."

Any-Background-7568,1,"Global exposure has multiple options  u can fulfil by going overseas (I think u bear the full cost) OR category C which u just need to complete the mod on e-learn.

The number of mods to take per sem per annum is subjective. For e.g When I first joined, I was given 3 Free-elective CUs for free literary.  Hence instead of having to need 36CUs to grad (for IS) I only need 33 CUs then I just plan the min no of mods I have to take to grad on time.

It is said to be easier to score when ure  junior.

Yes if u go to the page about ur degree info it is layer out for u alr like e.g the tracks.

Orientations don't matter if u know how to navigate ur resources but I think u shud becoz u can ask the seniors questions.

For the basket I'm not sure because I was preassigned 5 mods in year 1 sem 1. For sem2 I was preassigned 3 mods, then I can bid for any courses I want that fulfils my grad requirement (go to ur degree page the one where it shows ur track)

Also, internships and community services are 1CU each which are included in the 36CUs.

2. Completely depends on what you do for it. Usually at least a week I think, if you go overseas. Can be CSP, short term exchange, study mission or full exchange programme. I think there’s now elearn mods and overseas mods that clear global exposure too.

3. Also depends on what you prefer. Do you wanna chiong now or later? I at least wouldn’t recommend doing it right away, just so you can get used to uni life and commitments first.

4. You can do it in any order, but you have to finish all the requirements listed in your handbook.

kikapokka,4,"helloo, fellow soss pps student here.

1. first of all, students are given e$100 to bid every sem. for y1 soss students, there’ll be 3-4 mods pre-assigned. 

usually an avg of 4-5 mods are bidded per sem. 
if u choose to have a 5th mod, u can bid for one. in the case where you’re preassgn 4 mods, you’ll have e$20 remaining. similarly, if you’re preassgn 3 mods, you’ll have e$40 left. (u get the math) 

it’s entirely up to you if u wna hve a 5th mod, but hving 4 mods per sem is the usual.

freshmen bidding starts on 29th July, you shld be able to see ur preassgn mods on BOSS during that week by then. 


2. (honestly can’t rmb which is which but for soss):
Basket A: Intro to Psych, Understanding Societies, SEA
Basket B: WR, Econs & Society, Big Questions, Intro to Politics and Policy Studies 

whichever basket you’ll be in first is random.
you’ll only know once ur preassgn mods are out on BOSS. 

take note: if you’re in Basket A in sem 1, you’ll take Basket B in sem 2. (vice versa)


3. (i was exempted frm calculus, so i can’t ans this!) but heard that the mod is mainly abt differentiation and integration. 


4. unless you’re exempted frm calculus, the ans is no. you wld need to take both calculus AND intro to stats.

for us soss, we usually take intro to stats.
stats theory is usually for those in soe.
but it’s entirely uty on which stats mod u wna take.

hope i managed to answer ur qns! jiayous for bidding and atb for your first sem in smu :)"
idevilledeggs,3,"1) You'll have to bid yourself. You can check the [academic calender](https://inet.smu.edu.sg/sites/courses/Documents/Current%20or%20Future%20Academic%20Calendar/2022-2023/2022-23.pdf) to check when the bidding will occur. Freshmen do not share bidding with the rest of the school.
2) The school will sent an email regarding what basket you'll be in. These mods will be preassigned and you do not have to bid for them. Depending on the number, you won't even have to bid for additional mods if you don't want to. Most seniors recommend you take 4 mods in y1s1.
3) As someone who got D in maths in JC, it's not too bad? I didn't do calculus specifically; I did Stat theory which is harder the Stats. But it was overall quite ok.
4) For PPS? No, you have to take calculus to fulfil your numeracy basket unless exempted. In which case, you can take stats. Like I mentioned earlier, intro to stat theory is harder but the bids are cheaper. In this regard, you might want to avoid it. You can check the [school handbook](https://inet.smu.edu.sg/sites/courses/Documents/Student%20Academic%20Handbook/BSocSc/BSocSc%20Handbook_2019-20.pdf) for more details."

1. From my understanding, we will live in an apartment unit. So like a house with kitchen and sharied toilet. But this kitchen wont be fully fledged. And there we can keep our own food etc and arrange with each other. 

The common kitchen prob we go there with ingredients, cook and cleanup. Bring all stuff back

2. Also only 2 floors in psr with no lift"
theskyveryblue,1,"there are 3 blocks. each block is split into 2 separate sections. each section of each floor is one apt. btw psr has 4 floors not 2. so each apartment (10rooms) wld share one common area (incl the kitchen). imagine it as a 10bedroom house basically. most apartments dont share groceries if im not wrong. theres no stove as well, so its up to ur apt whether u guys wld want to split n share cost to buy an induction cooker. theres 2 fridges provided for each apt, so u can store wtv stuff u buy in there. if u guys choose not to buy an induction cooker, each apt still comes with a microwave for quick heating up of ur food. anw psr is extremely conveniently located so theres many food options ard if u choose not to cook. 

would say the best thing abt psr is rly that its prob cheaper than renting an apartment. n u hv the opportunity to make friends. of course, the apt may not be the cleanest at times, esp nearing the end of the sem when everyones too busy to clean up."

2. Academic briefing email will likely come mid to late July


3. There's an event called Vivace which is like a CCA fair during which all the CCAs will host chat rooms and sessions for you to explore. During this period, CCAs will be opening up recruitments and send out EDMs. Signing up is really easy, most of the time just filling up a google form with a CCA trial after if you are joining competitive CCAs.

jewjewbae,1,"Hi!! You can msg me on reddit, i just ended my WSE :)"
Koufas,2,"In general (oversimplifying) there are

Mods that are generally calculation heavy ie give you numbers, you memorise formulas, then you solve. Graphs are usually included. These usually apply to Micro mods

Then you will also find mods whereby your manipulation needs to be good and have strong fundamentals. Instead of working with numbers and calculations all the time its more of using math as logic to solve problems

For example you learn 4 equations with say 10 variables in total and some of these equations interact with one another. If you change x to (x-a) how does it change the system of equations compared to before?

Macro mods are usually like this - as well as some of the intermediate mods that you can come across.

Then finally you have the more quantitative side of econs, or metrics. How do you use stats in a way to solve economic problems? This is usually what people refer to as the basics of technical economic analysis. Its heavy in statistical methods

Most econs mods are generally some combination of the three, although there are also mods that are more qualitative in nature. But even then, they might be taught as qualitative but they rely on previously established quantitative studies 

EDA is a good first mod to get acquainted with as it teaches you how to read econs/stats research papers so i would suggest taking it first if you are new to econs as a discipline. Metrics is rough but its good to take it early too so in your future mods when you are doing your own reading/extra readings its a lot easier to understand them

Would also suggest taking EDA + Metrics before taking a Political Economy mod as it is more of an econs/stats mod at its core"

Koufas,1,">Since SMU is known to not have lectures I’m just wondering how do they split us up into small class seminar groups? Is it completely random or based on when you schedule your classes? (Not sure if LLB is flexi in allowing you to schedule classes?)  


For pre-assigned classes, it is random. But you can usually e-mail your school's admin to make a case so as to why you need to change your pre-assigned class timing. If they think it is valid (ie work schedules), they will usually make a case for you to the Registrar. I will stress that it is important to go to your school for help instead of directly to the Registrar

For non pre-assigned classes, you will have to bid for your classes yourself. When you bid for a module, you bid for a specific class rather than a module, which means you are in control of your Prof, class timing, and which module you want to take. You should google ""SMU Law Handbook"" and have a read, it should contain more details on your course curriculum. You will find out more during your academic talk as well

You can find out more about bidding on Oasis I think or just search for more info on the sub, I vaguely recall some questions on bidding last year

&#x200B;

>Does SMU have its own version of notes sharing? If I’m not wrong, in NUS the notes sharing culture is q strong where nus law seniors share their notes w juniors through a link or sth? Just wondering if sth like this exists for smu!

There are Tele groups by students for each faculty. For the Law Tele chat, there are a couple of templates/pre-writes students have shared in the chat. If you ask for notes or assistance I'm sure there will be people who will PM you directly to share what resources they have. I would suggest only asking for what you need and only after you have tried to put in some work on your own - usually when its closer to exam period after you are nearing the end of the course. This way, you will be able to tailor pre-writes/notes you bring into the exam according to your own learning instead of relying on someone else wholesale which might not yield as effective results (although it will save you time)

>Is there competition for getting into law clubs? Eg any interviews required? Or it’s for anyone to join!  


If you mean moot club, anyone can join. You don't need experience

>What are some of the toughest law modules? And what are the manageable ones?  


All law modules require a lot of effort if you want to do well. There is no ""easy"" law module imo, but most are manageable with sufficient work done

One exception is perhaps Dystopian Films where you watch one Black Mirror episode as your pre-readings a week, but that also requires quite a bit of effort in your assignments.

Some students might find some of the more academically-geared law modules such as Constitutional Law more challenging because of its nature (and workload). Some might also find Legal Theory challenging due to it being of a slightly different nature from most law modules

&#x200B;

>How often are exams held? What’s the format like ? (Written essays? Mooting / debating?)  


Most law modules assess you by timed essays in an exam setting. Its pretty much all open book. Mooting is a different thing 

&#x200B;

>Any useful tips are great too!!!! Like what websites / resources you normally use to prep for exams / revise , thank you :D

Lawnet will become your new best friend - some say the only one you can really rely on. Lawnet is where you can read judgements of cases, which is pretty much where grey areas are deemed to be slightly more black or white

For resources to revise for exams or prep, I mean there aren't that many so i think most would use lawteacher to supplement. Sometimes, there are academics who have done interesting hypotheticals in articles or research journals too depending on the topic

Most of the time it is a combination of your textbook, slides, notes you get from seniors and the internet, especially when you want to search for statutes or re-read specific cases etc

And Lawnet of course"
Soon-to-be-forgotten,5,"I think you meant [IDE](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Integrated_development_environment).

Tbh ig it may increase ur GPA if u took the module anyway but maybe u can see it as a wah to reduce modules taken. Then u can take computational thinking/other modules earlier"
SilentWarehouse,1,"From what I know, the IS111 mod is quite tedious.

shitama,4,"Also an international student matriculating this year so I’m not sure if everything I say is 100% accurate but here’s what I know:

- SMU is pretty much in the city center, so rent will be a lot more expensive if you’re searching for ones close to it. Maybe opt to look for ones near the mrt for easy travel 

- Instead of looking for condos, you could look into a common room in a HDB flat. Rates are usually 750-850 for them, unless you end up sharing the room as well. You can rent a master bedroom (your own bathroom) but those usually go for 1-1.2k a month.

- Try applying for Prinsep Street Residences for the 1st year since a lot of places require you to show your student pass in order to rent (which I think you won’t be getting until you’re physically there in SG). 

- Also, I recommend contacting an agent (if you haven’t) since they’ll be able to make the process a lot easier. I got all of the above info from mine! If you don’t, you have to be wary of fake listings.

Ideally, you should try to secure a place in PSR for the 1st year and find your own accommodation from the 2nd year onwards. It’s what I’m likely going to do as well. Atb!"

However, many IS graduates go on to become software engineers anyway and vice versa for CS graduates with non-technical jobs.

This should give you a much better idea of which modules you can take to clear different baskets

>Do you have any tips about bidding? How do I do this strategically so that I’ll always get the courses I need?  


If you want to save, you can look at baskets that you do not have much preferences for, and then choose the lower one. For example, if you have no preference between VUCA and CTRW, you could just bid for VUCA which is significantly cheaper

It is also good to plan out your modules and see which ones would require more e-credits before bidding

>Any tips to maintain a high GPA for the DDP? I’m an ASEAN scholar so I’ll have to maintain a 3.4 GPA to keep my scholarship. ;-; How realistic is this?

Well it depends on person to person tbh. IS is notoriously difficult compared to the other schools and most students there have a lower CGPA especially at the beginning. But if you work hard I'm sure that you can do it, 3.4 is very doable for the average student if you intentionally set aside time for school and learn how to strategise your studying etc"
Sensitive_Ad_9307,5,"First year PLE + Biz student here, 
1. Indeed PLE + Biz might not be the most “worth it” since there is only one mod that overlaps but whether it is practical really depends on you and what you want to do with your degree.

2. There are a couple of reasons why people end up dropping their second degree. A frequent one is that they don’t want to “overload” every sem and take more time (up to an additional year) to complete their undergrad. Another is that they realise a second major might suffice for the “diversification” or for the industry they are aiming for.

3. honestly, be it DDP/single degree, everyone has time, it’s just how you want to use it!

4. Yes there are requirements. They are not extremely difficult to meet but if you are indeed struggling to meet them after your first / second year, then maybe it’s not a good idea to take the ddp 

5. deciding which is your home faculty definitely matters. If you are interested in PLE, makes sense for social science to be your primary degree. 

Feel free to dm if you have more qns! (I am most likely going to drop, can tell you why privately)

My recommendation is to just apply/accept double degree. You can decide whether to drop as you flow along."

diamond_apache,8,"1) It depends on what ""courses"" you are talking about. There are good ones and useless ones. So without any more information, i can't really provide suggestions.


2) If you want to have a head start, I suggest learning python and get super good at it. python will be heavily used for IS, since there are several mods that uses python as the main language. I recommend grinding leetcode or hackerrank, and get familiar with data structures and algorithms(DSA) (and competitive programming if you have the time). I was into competitive programming at the beginning of my SMU days, and i felt it helped a lot (just my personal opinion, some might disagree). You might also want to learn abit of PHP and SQL since those 2 languages will also be used in IS Year 1


3) If I could relive my year 1 again, I wouldn't do anything differently. I actually did quite well in my year 1 (basically straight As, except for 1-2 mods). So I wouldnt do anything differently


4) i don't know whats the average GPA, i know some friends with super bad GPA, and some with really high GPA, but the sample size is too small to give you a reliable answer on what the average is


5) Main advice: try to master python, understand DSA really well, be good at maths also (there's 1-2 mods that feature alot of maths), listen in class, do ur homework without fail, go for consults whenever possible"

1. SOA + ADA (from SOA) and;

DSA from SOE focusses more on statistical methods for economic analyses ie time series, economic forecasting, panel/longitudinal data, fin data

Not too sure about ADA, but it seems to be more towards audit side ie Audit Analytics, Forensic Analytics

From what I am seeing, DSA requires 9 additional CUs. ADA is 8.

throwawayDontLitter7,7,"i have no coding background as I was from a biz diploma in poly. I kinda have a natural inclination for coding and just put in the work, gpa is around cum laude as a Y3 going to Y4, but that's after choosing to take difficult mods cos i wanted to learn more and also because i tend to pick up the slack when there are slackers around (sometimes i only have 1 day to before finals bcos of them) , so my gpa is not as high as it should be.

anyway, i struggled for the first half of my Y1S1 and managed to catch up in the 2nd half and got A- for programming. Subsequently after my first programming mod, i got all As for all my programming mods. currently abt to intern at MNC also, so its really up to abit of natural inclination + hardwork. 

So dont need scared, just need to learn coding properly. some people have background but they nvr learn properly, so it doesn't mean you cannot get your A because they are around. just need to stay on your own lane.

i have to say though, if you are looking for technical roles, like being a software engineer, please make full use of your holidays and get acquainted with leetcode and build your own projects so you can reach FAANG level, i regretted not doing that. 

Anyway, try to learn things properly and do your best and don't compare yourself with others. i think that would be your best bet moving forward. aptitude is quite impt though, if I'm being real, but good luck!"

Koufas,2,"Yep agree that there isn't much diff - in terms of what they are looking for, what probably matters more is your fin knowledge + modelling. This is largely in Biz school

But in the medium/long-term, if you are looking to stay within banking, I'd probably say econs second major + BBM as your first degree would offer you some exposure and skillsets that might make it easier to transition to other roles. For example FX/Rates Strategists or Credit/Macro research would need some econ background 

Could look into the Quantitative Econ Track and their modules + Economic Forecasting and Intermediate Econometrics for this purpose

Some knowledge of what makes financial markets tick on the macroeconomy side would also probably make your life easier - but honestly I feel like this is something you'll pick up from internships (albeit econs-related ones) rather than school. Joining SEIC is also an option in addition to fin CCAs like SMIF or EYE Investent. School would definitely offer you some fundamentals, though"
Good-Ad-9136,1,No diff
Koufas,36,"Hello! I juat finished Y3. A ton of things honestly. Just sharing what I think - it doesnt apply to everyone

First, Id take my university education more seriously from the start - which includes going for more networking events, more research/outreach  to explore my future career, and most importantly, planning my modules right from Year 1

The school has plenty to offer and honestly puts in a lot of resources into exposing students to future career paths, including a personal career coach that is actually pretty useful

I started doing career stuff quite late but was very fortunate to have found internships at places I am genuinely interested in. At least thinking about it in Y1 and browsing Linkedin to see the JD of various jobs you might be interested in the future would be good

University is much more than just academics, and I think those who get caught up only striving to achieve good grades are not making full use of what is available. This is not necessarily a bad thing of course, but it is something that I regretted as I am only finding out a lot of things later when those vying for similar roles (who are more from NUS and NTU) seem to know earlier on

And since our school fees are higher I should definitely be making full use of it lol

On planning modules, everyone has a different style of learning and what they are interested in. Someone into academia might enjoy Constitutional Law and exploring hypotheses, but someone more relationship-oriented might prefer the corporate side of things

Some might say Management Comms are a ""fluff"" mod, but to someone who speaks as a part-time job, it is not fluff at all

Trying to understand mods before we take them is so, so important - and this involves reaching out to random seniors, asking on Reddit, and e-mailing Profs. It can make the difference between taking on an impossible load that tanks your GPA vs having an enriching sem that does not crush you

Likewise, if you are good at group projects, bid for more SMU-X mods than mods with higher weightage for exams. Vice-versa if the opposite

It is also good to balance the workload. Generally, mods with more groupwork has more work during the sem, but youll have to study less for exams. Some modules are very project intensive with up to 3 presentations. Taking 2-3 of such modules is dangerous if you are unprepared. Conversely, avoid taking 5 exams in 1 sem. Some modules also might not have an exam in Week 15, but there is a 30% assignment due in Week 13. Would be good to plan out deadlines before you bid - I have an Excel template I can share with you that I used to track these things when I bid

Would highly recommend using a planner too, be it online or a physical one

I dont suggest planning out all 4 years from the start, but I do suggest having an idea of where you want to be and some choices you have to get there

And if you do not know what to take, dont worry! You have time to figure it out. Just clear your compulsory mods while you speak to seniors, industry professionals and Profs while you think about it

Second, making full use of SMU I feel also includes the non-career opportunities out there. It also includes going to Fortune Center for dinner/latenight prata with groupmates after a project meeting, trying out various CCAs to explore more hobbies, and using the school gym (it is not the most well-equipped but it is sufficient if your goal is just to stay healthy)

Most of my memorable experiences in SMU are these random moments honestly. Including meeting a group of 3 at McDonalds at 8am for McGriddles before meeting a client for one of our modules

Personally, I wish I attended more meetings of SMU E-Sports to play more games and chill with other gamers who are as passionate as I am about it

I think that something else that is also useful for prospective students to know is the nature of SMU being different from NUS/NTU, which means...

Third, SMU usually attracts a different type of student. You are more likely to find students interested in side-projects, creating their own start-up, and hustlers. This makes the landscape seem more competitive but I genuinely do think the whole ""SMU snake"" stereotype is kinda overblown. Dont get me wrong - Ive definitely met groupmates Id rather not work with again, but the community can actually be pretty helpful and collaborative when I reach out. It takes community to build a community - and I personnally find it more rewarding to be part of it. But this takes effort and energy (just like the world-at-large) and it is certainly not for everyone, all of the time

Fourth, the lack of hall life has more implications than just sleeping less (and sleeping less) at campus

I think it also means it might be more difficult to find organised groups (like halls) organising bonding and community activities. The barrier to go for social activities is also higher

For example, if you stay at a dorm in maybe NUS/NTU, maybe halls will organise an activity every now and then. To join you can go downstairs

But in SMU, you either create your own activity, or reach out to a CCA, or wait for a group to organise an event, stay in school until the event is over, then travel back home

Maybe in NUS/NTU at 12am if you wanna play Mahjong to destress you can just jio people and they will be nearby. After finish can just go back to sleep

But in SMU thats quite diffcult to do to the same extent. I mean that late at night most people still in school are probably trying to finish their work before going home or already have plans

But this doesn't mean that there are no opportunities at all. In fact, with the number and diversity of CCAs, the number of businesses nearby constantly organising opportunities to meet new people and work as a team, I think there are more opportunities to interact. Students also tend to be more open to having lunch etc after an event

Overall, while the resistance to reaching out is definitely higher, the opportunities are still by and large present"
MaretimeBayesian,4,"This one is on me, but I would have definitely gone to another uni had I known just how competitive it was. I came here to enrich my knowledge, not just to get a job or some shit like that."
Playful-Standard-946,5,"don’t worry too much about the competition. I spent whole of my first year in awe as to how competitive smu was and i had self doubts. but the minute you stop caring about others and just focus on yourself, trust the process and be yourself - you’ll do well! 

what’s important is you need to understand yourself well if you want to be happy in smu! for example, many people did all nighters in library before examinations and in my first year i was like how will i ever match them. heck, i even tried it myself but it didn’t work at all. the next year, i listened to my body and trusted whatever i did. i just took it easy, started on my goals early and sure enough i was celebrating these small wins along the way which i think are important! 

that’s the biggest takeaway i had in my time in smu! aside from that, just remember to have fun. these uni days only come once in your life time and it’s quite sad if you spend every hour of every day chasing for something or under stress. just learn to have fun with work and you’ll do extremely well!"

idevilledeggs,2,"1. Sort of. My brother in NUS would agree that there's not much of a student life. SMU has sufficient opportunities for a student life imo. My understanding is that SMU's student life is not heavily tied to dorm life unlike NUS and NTU and for that reason, there are opportunities outside of communal living to make friends. However, you need to push yourself to take advantage of these opportunities. You can't expect much of a social life if you don't actively partake in extra curricular activities.

2. Guaranteed 2nd major + my preferred course + i don't want a dorm life. 

3. You can accept SMU's offer first. If you change your mind, you can inform SMU that you'd like to withdraw but you would need to pay the matriculation fees in the mean time.

4. Yeah SMU has a low rank due to it's small size, which means a smaller diversity of courses and a lower research output. According to the post-graduate survey, SMU graduates don't face lower job prospects than NUS/NTU graduates. However, I'm not sure how this would play out in an overseas context. You might way to check with your state's labour ministry to check if SMU's degree is recognised where you live."

[https://scis.smu.edu.sg/bsc-computer-science/curriculum/majors/it-solution-development](https://scis.smu.edu.sg/bsc-computer-science/curriculum/majors/it-solution-development)

The main difference between SMU and other schools are the same as the other courses:

1. Intensity and frequency of group projects. Actually, I have noticed that among my Year 3 and Year 4 friends in CS, it is not uncommon to take multiple SMU-X modules. SMU-X modules are basically structured in a way such that your project weightage is rather high compared to other modules, and you work with an external client. For some reason, seems like my friends in CS are taking way more SMU-X modules compared to the average student. Most SMU students take 1 to try it out and then 2 or 3 at the most, but I have friends from CS who are doing 2-3 in just one sem alone. There seems to be a lot more SMU-X courses available which translates into more experiences working with actual clients
2. Class participation. In-person lessons are much better than online ones for CS as the Prof is able to go around and help out instead of things being online all the time. Seems like the smaller volume allows the Prof to be more hands-on at times
3. The usual differences between SMU in general still applies: City Campus meaning easily accessible (+ you will never get bored of food), a very vibrant student life, cooperative competition, more career-focussed CCAs, plenty of student led initiatives, etc

Overall I think the curriculum is about the same between NTU, SMU, and NUS (with NUS likely being just slightly more technical, but the difference imo is negligible). What really matters is what you want your student life to be like. Honestly, I feel like this actually matters more than academics these days, because skills can always be picked up on your own. But you can never pick up or regain school culture from somewhere else

I can try to put you in touch with someone from SMU CS if you want, just PM me"

In my scholarship agreement, it is stated that the school may give warning

Just like my secondary school scholarship, i think that in practice, they may give a few chances (and scoldings) for the first time when you didnt manage.

But i think if you didnt manage to buckle up they will terminate it"
Successful_Hope_6519,2,hey! im also an international student applying with IB. I had my interview on the 1st of April and have not heard back yet.. im also very anxious about it. What course did you apply and where are you from? :)
Delicious_Manager_28,1,"as long as you declare that as your major, you will get accepted haha so no competition

diff is it’s more qualitative than quantitative (so more fluff and less math/calculations) but but you should Google the SMU Business Management student handbook bc there are still some core mods you must take as a SMU BBM student so like Financial Accounting, Statistics, Finance, etc. 

Anws for the career prospects & the specific modules etc and what it’s about, you should rlly go and take a look at the SMU website bc it has all the info there! :) 

You can Google for the course outline of specific modules & student handbooks etc! Everything is avail online but you need to slowly read thru and analyse I guess.

Hope this helps, feel free to ask more haha too lazy to answer your points one by one

and ofc if you compare finance major and comms major ofc comms major modules is less of exams, more on projects and assignments. but other than the major modules, there are also core modules which would be the same regardless. so do research on the SMU core, business core, major core, major electives etc and what the courses are (student handbook should have)

Anws if you rlly get accepted and need more info that you can’t find online, can feel free to pm me ya"

If it's one of the core modules, you probably need to retake it next semester. If it's one of the electives, I'm not super sure, probably F grade.

On that note, depending on your degree, majors, tracks whatnot, you may not be able to bid for certain modules as you can't fulfil the prequisites."

You can take this as reference I guess..? 😊

I agree taking at least 16GB ram. But if you can afford it, take laptops that support 32 GB, the problem is most ultrabooks only support up to 16GB with exception of the higher end laptops.

You don’t need a high end cpu to code, but you need to open lots of windows, and simultaneously run several programs.

Also in case of school going back online you might need turn on zoom for classes while running your IDE in the background, maybe also pdf textbooks if you need to refer if not textbooks then you probably need to refer to STACKOVERFLOW 😝

lelscrubsh1t,1,Did mine a few days ago. It was a group interview and the professor simply gave us a topic to discuss. He then asked us two questions based on the topic and each of us took turns to answer. My best advice is to listen and understand the questions asked. The topics are quite general so dont worry too much. Just dont jump the gun during the interview and answer when tou are ready or when you are asked.
monke_booty,7,"People usually do CSPs or any other curriculum activities just because it’s one of the few times you can still ‘enjoy’ uni life. I say don’t stress yourself out trying to find an internship in year 1. That being said, internships are extremely important for job prospects in the future so don’t start too late. My advice: do it in year 2 onwards."
Soon-to-be-forgotten,4,"Most people I know only start doing internships from year 2 so I guess you would have an advantage if you start from year 1?

But depending on your degree/major, you may find it extremely difficult to get one at year 1, since you have little experience (both academically and work experience). Of course, this is assuming that you have no background in the field."
isleftisright,3,"My biggest regret in uni is not slacking off during my holidays. I took internships all holidays except for y1s1 and y4.

In the end, multiple internships arent important. They are only important (1) to fulfil school requirements (2) if it can lend you something of a job. 

Other than that, unless it's something in particular you want to get from the internship (e.g figure out what a particular job entails) not too much point."

Koufas,5,"Well I can't talk a lot about BBM, but if you want you can PM me and I can try to redirect you to someone I know depending on what interests you have. Since you can take a lot of classes, and have very different paths, I think every SMU student will have a different experience from each other.

The Pros (comparatively speaking) are the usual things associated with SMU: you work in groups a lot more, greater emphasis on speaking out, top-notch academic CCAs, more people who treat school/career more seriously...

Main con is the lack of hall life. But that does not mean there is no student life - if anything I think ours is very vibrant. Just no hall life

Second main con is probably lack of large competitive sports CCAs

In terms of final marks, for every class you will see a breakdown of the graded components before you bid. For example, it can be something like (for example):

Class Part - 15%

Mid-terms - 15%

Group Project (Presentation) - 15%

Group Project (Report) - 15%

Finals - 40%

Class part is almost always between 10 to 20% of your final grade. During the sem, for most classes, there will be a Teaching Assistant (TA) who takes note of class part. Some TAs are instructed to take down every word to assess quality and quantity, but most TAs only note down quantity and maybe if it is quality they might assign you more marks.  Some Profs have a cap on Class Part score per lesson as well to prevent people from speaking out just for the sake of speaking. Some Profs have no TAs noting down class part so the Prof just gives everyone a baseline score like A-, then those who are memorable/speak out more than the norm they give higher. TAs are usually seniors who have sat through the class and received an A band in a previous sem 

Do I think SMU is worth it? Well this is a very broad question. This will vary from person to person. But I think most people would say yes. Those who say no usually regret their choice of course that could have only been found elsewhere, not necessarily school life. 

I think to fully take advantage of uni life, we have to remember that school is not just lessons. There are also people, communities, CCAs, events, Profs... A lot of things to participate in and take advantage of. Would strongly suggest taking part in them to make it more worth it"

Koufas,3,"Hello. I don't think anyone has a formal background in this major before uni tbh so you're good. It is the same thing as students who are taking medicine or law or CS for the first time, they also do not have formal training or education on the topic and are choosing to do it anyway. It is quite common I think

For the record, I did not know what I wanted to do in the future when I chose this course - and I am still undecided. It is ok to not know 100% yet - that is what uni (and life) is for :) I think as long as you feel you will be happy with what you have learnt, then you will be okay

Regarding your career prospects, you could also take a second major ie Data Science and Analytics, Finance, Health Economics etc if you want to gain some skills in other areas, although I feel your internships/projects/experiences matter more than this

Also, I and other posters have answered these questions rather extensively in this sub and in r/SGExams \- you can just search for ""PLE"" or ""Politics, Law, and Economics"" in both subs in the search bar and similar questions will pop out with some of these answers

You may also scroll through my profile history for what I have written on this

If you have questions on specific modules or other more specific questions, feel free to drop me a DM or reply to this comment so other people searching for this topic in the future can read it too :) Thanks"
synrg18,3,"I’d say if you’re interested in it then you should do it. I had no background in any of the subjects beforehand so it was a bit of a challenge but still more than manageable. I did find out midway that I didn’t have interest in 2/3 of the subjects (oops) but nonetheless there’s enough flexibility to work around it as long as you’re still interested in one of the tracks. That being said, it is still a Social Sci major so you should expect to write often.

Like Koufas, I also had no clear direction which is why I opted for the course. The diversity of subjects helps you learn more about your interests and as I’m approaching my final year I’m only now getting more clarity on my career goals through my internships, so don’t feel like taking this choice will damn you forever or something. I suspect you’ll have a bit more of an edge going into government work but again, internship and other co-curricular experiences will play a big if not bigger role than the major itself.

I recommend following Koufas’s advice and doing more research. I suggest doing some light reading on the three subjects as well as a primer to see if you really do like them (or most of them at least). Otherwise, if you end up having second thoughts, you could still consider other options."

3. If you are unfamiliar and have ZERO knowledge on the topic, then I would say be honest. However, do attempt to at least be engaging and ask questions back to the interviewer.

If you are still really worried, my best advice will be researching on the professor and modules that you wish to bid for (afterclass). For example, there's a professor that sets really hard papers for micro1 (whole class fail hard), but ensures that you go in strong for micro2, so you really got to pick your poison. The best tip perhaps is knowing yourself, how much you can cope, and when to drop a mod when you actually need to"
Koufas,3,">  
  
For PLE, what is the curriculum about? 

There is already a ton of information available online about the curriculum of PLE, including all of the classes you can take under the course. I can help you navigate it if you are unfamiliar with it, but do check it out on SMU's website.

In short, the way Uni works is that the school will give you a bunch of requirements to complete your degree. For reference, a class (or a module/mod) spans one semester (15 weeks). So lets say to complete a degree there are 5 general education classes you have to choose from a wide basket, 10 classes that the school deems fundamental to your degree, and then 10 classes of your choice that the school offers, that is under your field. The last group is called ""Major Electives"", or electives that fall under your chosen major. 

So lets say a student only studying one discipline/field will probably take something like (for example, this is not accurate, just an example)...

General Education: Management Communications, Spreadsheet Modelling, etc...

Compulsory for Major: Intro to Microeconomics, Intro to Macroeconomics, Math for Econs, Intermediate Econs, Econometrics, etc...

Major Electives: Advanced Macroeconomics, Globalisation, Economics of Trade, etc...

But, PLE is different because you need to take modules from 3 different fields, as well as interdisciplinary modules, as part of your compulsory classes for your major. These fields are Political Science, Law, and Economics. So instead, your classes can look like this:

General Education: Management Communications, Spreadsheet Modelling, etc...

Compulsory for Major: Intro to Microeconomics, Intro to Macroeconomics, Business Law, Governance through Law in Singapore, Political Theory, Politics of Southeast Asia, etc...

Major Electives: Advanced Macroeconomics, Health Law and Ethics, International Relations, Political Economy of East Asia, Econometrics

The specific number of classes, the names of the classes, and the exact breakdown of requirements for PLE (and of all degrees) are online. Let me know if you have any difficulties locating them.

There are a few implications of the syllabus of PLE students. Since you take a wider variety of classes...

First, your knowledge will be wider and you gain competencies over different fields. There are some who might say this takes away from depth, which is true to a certain extent, but I don't think that it affects vertical knowledge significantly to an extent it becomes a hindrance. I do feel that it is easier to pick up vertical knowledge on our own through internships, online courses, and self-initiated projects in SMU-X courses for example where we work with clients for projects. I think that it is much harder to train yourself to learn about a completely new industry or field if you have no formal education in it to do so. For example, learning law from scratch in a classroom is much easier (and importantly: accurate) than learning law from somewhere like Reddit. But if you want to deepen your knowledge about the law, you can look for judgements online or legal principles. 

Second, to maintain a higher GPA, you will need to do well in multiple fields. To do well in your law mods, you must understand legal principles sufficiently for example (heavily simplifying it here - law is a difficult degree). If you only take law modules, the skills and competencies build up overtime. However, in PLE, you need to do well in Econs, Law, and Pol Sci modules. You need different competencies, and you need to be able to switch between them quickly. Some might feel this is more difficult as you need to keep switching. That being said, GPA honestly is mattering less and less these days compared to what you are able to do

Third, due to pre-requisites of higher level classes, it takes slightly more planning to map out how you want to plan your classes. Cannot just take classes you want to - must really think about the requirements before committing to it. Makes going on exchange slightly more difficult too

I do think that if you really enjoy learning and applying yourself to different fields, PLE is very useful and engaging. 

&#x200B;

>Would there be a lot of math with the econs component? And if I am bad at math, will I struggle?

In PLE, there are 4 compulsory Econs mods you must take at a minimum. Econs and Society (JC econs), Math for Econs, Micro 1 and Macro 1. Other than these 4 econs mods, you can work your way through the rest of the PLE curriculum to avoid econs completely. On that note...

First, there are econs mods that are not heavy in math. For example, Economic Development in Asia is imo a good Y1 mod because the Prof teaches you how to read stats and research papers. Mostly about developmental economics in Asian economies

Second, I think there is this thinking that econs in uni = math. While it is true that there is a LOT of math, at the same time, it is not the exact same math we are used to at a JC level. To me, the way I see it is really about logic and using math to express relationships and how things work. Don't get me wrong there are still calculations, and a lot of them, but equally or more important is the logic we will learn is also about relationships between different factors. Exam questions can be as simple as they introduce a shock (ie x change to x-1) and ask how will that affect the rest of the model overtime. Not pure calculation alone, but using math as logic to investigate and prove something. But hey this is just my experience so far!

Honestly I don't think my shining point is my mathematical skills - in fact, calculations were one of my weaker points during my sec school and JC years that I needed to work hard on. But I am choosing to take more Econs mods in spite of it. Because I appreciate the value and importance of what I am learning, and am working hard to make sure I do alright. Including crunching the numbers. And if I can do it so can you!

Third, to answer your question, MFE is all about math, Macro 1 and Micro 1 both have a healthy mix of pure math and logic. More so for Macro than Micro imo. But you will still need to do calculations of course

&#x200B;

>What are the job prospects for PLE students?  


Too wide for me to list. Nowadays, it is not about the label printed on your degree. But rather, it is about what modules you have taken (which in PLE can be so many), what experiences you have been through (which varies from person to person) and what skills you have chosen to pick up in your own free time (which again varies).

There are seniors in consulting, research/analyst, public policy, banking and finance, social impact, marketing, start-ups, FnB... Really too many. Degrees are becoming less and less of a strong predictor of job prospects.

&#x200B;

>Same for PPS, what is the curriculum about?

For PPS, most of the information is widely available online already. In general, you will take some intro classes in each field (Intro to Pol and Policy Studies, Understanding Societies, Intro to Psych) and then declare your chosen major by the end of Y1. Then, same as other degrees - choose from the modules that the school offers

&#x200B;

>What are the job prospects for PPS students?

My answer will be the same as above: it really depends on those 3 things. Which can change even while you are in Uni. But probably more along the research and public policy route compared to PLE.

But I suggest getting a second opinion from someone in PPS. I have friends in PPS who would probably happy to speak with you about job prospects - am happy to ask around and link you up.

&#x200B;

>I heard that there is an interview for PLE, does the same applies for PPS? Any tips on how I can prepare for the interview?

In SMU there is an interview for all majors. In terms of tips. First, have a strong sense of who you are, your purpose, and your passions. This would allow you to show how you might be able to contribute to the school. Second, have a strong sense of why you want to choose this particular degree and school, and if possible, how you intend to use this knowledge. Third, read up on current affairs and about topics related to the interview you are going for.

Seems like you are going through quite a lot trying to decide your direction - which can be really daunting. Dropped you a PM through chat. All the best!"

Soon-to-be-forgotten,2,"Usually, CSP hours are a selling point for committee recruitments. 

So, if it isn't stated anywhere, just assume it doesn't. But you can try asking the organising committee if you are still unsure."
Koufas,3,"Yes

In the PPS programme, in Y1 you will have to take an Intro mod to Psych, Intro to Public Pol Studies, and Understanding Societies. This is to give some basic exposure

But after declaring your major at the end of Y1 you will specialise in only Psych, only Pol Sci, or only Socio

Feel free to AMA

Edit: Just looked through your post history. I am from sosci and can probably answer most of your questions, but if you want, I can try to find some friends doing either a double degree in psych/biz or at the very least a psych first degree and second major in a biz major

Sensitive_Ad_9307,2,"Hi OP, was a local IB student as well. Can’t provide you with a grade range but with a 43, you won’t have any issues.

(I’m not saying you must or should, just letting you know that you can haha). But congrats on doing well for IB :)"
Sensitive_Ad_9307,6,"1. Yes, your free elective will be used to clear your CU requirements for your second major
2. If you choose Econs, you will be graduating with a bachelor of science (economics). If you choose Finance, finance is a business major so you will be graduating with a bachelor of business management. The uni core mods will be almost identical (Econs has a specific numeracy mod that other faculty students don't have to take) and you are right to say that the main difference is that for Finance (you will be taking 11 biz core CUs + 6 Finance majors CU) and for Econs (9-10 Econs core + 5-6 Econs Elective) For the second majors, most of the time the req is around 8 additional CU which essentially takes up the free electives
3. From what I understand, Econs in SMU is very math heavy so you should take that into consideration."
monke_booty,1,"Hi recent graduate here, I can try to answer some of your questions:

1) For lectures, it is more intimate in the sense that the rooms are smaller which allows you the opportunity to be noticed by the professor more. However, how personal you want to be with the professor is entirely up to how you want to interact with the prof. Some of the classes and profs are engaging enough to warrant interactions, but some are not, so that factor affects it as well.

2) I am not from accounting, but I am pretty sure that every school undergoes similar interview processes. In my opinion, of course, academic ability is a factor of success in the interviews, however, the key ability is to articulate the points in a group interview confidently (which is designed to model our class style). So, just articulate your points confidently and stick to your opinions.

3) I cant help there, my friend."
mngomllk,3,"hello!! i’m a ddp student at smu the minimum rp is 85rp i think!! ik someone who got missed the cut by a little bit (84) and appealed but cldnt get it so theyre p strict on this for ddp i think they strictly see ur rp so idt aba will help in this case? 

nevertheless if ur gpa meets the cut in y1/y2  you’ll be eligible to apply for ddp too

imo biz and accountancy is one of the most worth ddp there are a lot of overlapping mods (u can read the handbook) so out of all the ddp programs that smu offers it has the least amount of mods to clear so u can definitely clear in 4 years if u overload abit (ie take 5 mods per sem instead of the usual 4 mods)"
edud_neb,1,"Sounds like you don’t know what you want. Cause both degrees are mutually exclusive when getting a job.

Koufas,1,"*Note: the other person who commented on this is shadowbanned*

Hello there :)

After \~20 years of living, it is likely you are at least slightly aware of...

\- What your interests are (professionally and personally. Do you gravitate towards a certain role, software or style when doing a group project? What do you like to do in your free time?)  
\- What your competencies are (mathematics? solving problems in a certain field? maybe you are good with people?)  
\- What your values are (passion? Earning $$? Purpose? Like helping children, maybe you are religious, or maybe you enjoy making insights)  
\- What your goals are (marry in mid-20s? Need earn more. Ok with waiting a bit? Its ok, can progress later)

I'd suggest writing a list to help you decide and commit to what you want to define as important to you

After you decide on these things, you can start to narrow down your job search already to the kind of roles and industries. For example if you value work-life balance, certain fields are less likely to offer this. If you value passion/purpose, you need to find something you believe in or align with.

If you do not have a preference, or if you genuinely do not know, I'd suggest asking your close friends for suggestions as they usually have an inkling of what you might be good at doing or like to do.  If you are still unconvinced and undecided, I'd suggest trying to take on more experiences with whatever time you have (ie part-time job, part-time internship, volunteer with certain sectors, initiate more self-started projects) to try and get some experience. Need to try enough things to have a better understanding of who you are or who you want to be. This usually involves more experiences, such as speaking with people already in these roles, or doing more internships/projects. The bottom line is that we only know more about ourselves through these experiences, and if we don't try to put ourselves through them, we will never know. Gotta put ourselves out there and try

If you do not like the experience, that is ok - at least you tried and have a better understanding of what you like, don't like, can or cannot do, etc. And it is only 3-4 months

It is perfectly fine to LOA to take a few internships in a row to find out what you like even at the cost of delayed graduation. I know someone in SMU who is in Y3, will be graduating a year later than most people, but is currently on his 5th internship. The intern pay is sufficient for him, but he does not save much. A very good trade-off imo since he wants to plan his career very carefully.

If you need personalised help, you (and I guess anyone reading this) can feel free to PM me on Reddit. I (and a few friends) regularly informally help juniors/mentees to narrow down their future major and career choices. If you want to find out more about a certain industry, you can PM me too and I can see who would be willing to speak to you about it"
Soon-to-be-forgotten,3,"Nice website!

Originally that the mobile website was faulty, then I realised that SMU doesn't like to provide median incomes for some weird reasons."
Soon-to-be-forgotten,3,"I'm not in a business major but my advice is always to apply for all the courses you can apply, provided that you want to enter the course.

It gives you more choices, just in cause a school rejects you.

Consider to post in r/sgexams to learn more about other universities."
Koufas,1,"Hello

You should definitely apply to all 3 if you want more options and are not sure at this point of time. Only limit yourself if you are sure you do not want something

In SMU, Comms Management itself is a major - you can choose to take that as your first or second major. If you are really interested in it, SMU also offers a MSc in Communication Management for you to consider

Double major/degree is only worth if you are really interested in what they have to offer. It takes a lot of work to maintain a double degree, and you would likely have to overload yourself a sem or two, or spend a summer clearing a course or two

I think it really depends on your end-goals. If you feel like hall life is important, then NUS and NTU is definitely for you

But if you enjoy a seminar-style pedagogy where your classmates are participative in class, then SMU is the clear choice

Can't say too much about the other schools, but what I can say is that SMU probably has the most vibrant student life out of the three choices. COVID-19 means that instead of this vibrancy being on show, you have to show up in different pockets where different groups can have their own sessions while staying in line with regulations

CCAs are extremely vibrant, and if you are looking for extra-curriculars to jumpstart your career or to just have fun with like-minded people I can say that there are many events, groups and CCAs that have these people in them. Also career-wise, some CCA EXCOs intentionally organise things/sessions to guide students further towards further career choices

I'd suggest going for the Open House to find out more. PMs are open for questions on SMU"
Esphyr,2,"Hi! Not a Senior but I’m currently in the EXCO for 2 different CCAs (1 Student Govt Body and 1 Club). 

Based on some of the interviews I went through and personal observations: 

1. Prepare some responses to common interview questions. The usual generic questions (tell me about yourself, what makes you suited for the role, what are your strengths and weaknesses) ALWAYS come up, usually as the first 2-3 questions. Make sure you tailor your responses to suit the role you’re applying for (e.g, if you’re applying for Honorary General Secretary and when asked about your strengths and weaknesses, DO NOT mention that you can be unorganised at times - even if you consider it to be a weakness of yours). 

2. Study for the role you’re aiming for. It’s quite common for the EXCO to ask scenario based questions in interviews related to your role. Knowing what you’re interviewing for is important - if you can’t answer a question related to the role you’re applying for, why should they give it to you?

3. Befriend the current EXCO. No, really, I know of a few people who had it slightly easier to get into EXCO positions (including one EXCO I’m currently in) because they are friends with the previous EXCO (aka the people that choose who to recruit). However, these few also did have the skills to back it up - their friendship just made the decision process easier.

Based on a conversation with my Y4 friend, the “prime time” for EXCO would be in Y1 and Y2 since that’s when studies are still somewhat “chill” compared to the later years. But don’t limit yourself to these 2 years; I know of a few people who joined in Y3 too. 

I can’t really advice on joining EXCOs in Y3 and Y4 but would say if you have the time, it could be fun :) we only have 4 years of uni so might aswell enjoy ourselves."

Most of the time, after the school semester ends, if the Prof needs a new TA, they will e-mail a few candidates about it. Those who scored A- and above, or maybe students they have noted down during the class as potential TAs. A- is the standard requirement they will look at first, though. Likely has something to do with SOP but not 100% sure

If the Prof is unable to find a suitable candidate, it will be opened up to the rest of the class or the whole school through e-mail

All candidates will go through an interview process. After selection you will go for a short IT course on how to navigate/use/manage e-learn from the perspective of someone who has the rights to adjust things on it"

Soon-to-be-forgotten,1,"Hiyo, I took this module before.

There has been only one iteration of this module with  one class in last semester, hence no reviews.

I assumed the professor is still Patrick De Oliveira?

The workload is quite light in my opinion. The readings can be quite a lot but the professor doesn't purposely test your knowledge every week.

Your project would be a presentation for an assigned week, which is extremely doable as long as you understand your subject well.

If you excel in your memorisation skills, you're in luck. The hardest part is the mid-term, which you need to memorise information regarding topics from the slides and readings. The professor would actually give us a list of keywords, not everything would be tested, as hints.

Even if you're not good at memorising things (like me), there's still the essay. Can be pretty fun to think and write if you genuinely enjoy the topic.

Koufas,3,"Hihi

I recommend it to be taken in Y1 because under Prof Sunha Myong, you will learn concepts which are derived from research papers pretty much. She is a very knowledgeable Prof in her field for sure

Essentially, the class is going through 2-3 research papers per week, and during class she will explain what it is about. Would be very useful if you are looking to look at stats/econs papers in the future imo. In the later weeks youll have 2 presentations every lesson by other groups after the break.  Presentations are very doable, although if you go the extra mile and put in the effort an A for presentation is very achievable. Due to the large volume of presentations (2-3 a week) it also means class part is easy to score

Pre-readings are recommended, but not strictly necessary. Would recommend taking a look at the papers for maybe 30 mins before class but I got by without doing the pre-readings (although, I was Y2S2 when I took it so I had more experience reading papers). Perfect if you have just taken stats too

Exam is manageable; a mix of MCQ, SEQ, and Essay. Full marks is definitely possible if you commit to studying. Very manageable mod overall

You can PM me for more in-depth info on the mod if you want, but definitely would classify it as a doable 5th mod despite it having a finals. Best taken in Y1 for maximum benefit"

Koufas,2,"Hello. Not from SOE, but from PLE and have taken Econs mods

AFAIK MFE is a prereq for Micro 1, but I could be wrong. There was some overlap with both of them, and MFE would help understand some fundamentals for Micro 1. It was very relevant and there were quite a bit of overlaps, but to be very honest I forgot most of what I learnt in MFE other than general principles so not sure how much it actually helped me

Even though the school seems to push econometrics really hard early as they are heavily suggested as a prereq for other econs mods, it isnt strictly speaking required and my friends from SOE generally agree that econometrics isnt really necessary

Id recommend taking MFE first before Micro 1 and clearing your other Uni Core mods if you want to stave off econometrics. Not sure if its mandatory for SOE students, but PLE students arent forced to take econometrics, and to fulfill some of our tracks we have to take some of the more advanced econs mods

MFE for me was a big hurdle to get over and I personally found it difficult, in part due to it being an online sem halfway through my sem... Micro 1 was easier for me due to MFE, but if you feel confident in math and have the time to work hard youll be fine

Micro in Y2S1 is fine, but a hefty portion of SOE students takes it in Y1S2. Idt itll slow you down that much in the long run"

Koufas,7,"Depends on the mod and the Prof as well as how much you know about the mod beforehand

For my BGS and PSEA class its impossible to get higher than a B if you didnt do pre-readings

MC for me was an A without doing readings though

Honestly you have to judge it on your own. Only you know yourself best. Sorry cant really answer here but tbvh its very dependent on the Prof, mod, and your prior knowledge

Usually you'll do okay though if its a gen ed mod. Not a lot of gen-ed Profs test something really specific that can only be found in the text, although for mods that have essay writing as deliverables like BQ your content will 100% be poorer in quality compared to those who did readings and can weave relevant arguments

I really wouldn't recommend skipping all your pre-readings if you're aiming for A/A+, though, unless you have some kind of background knowledge/experience...

It also depends on where you get your summaries from

If this is your first year I suggest just doing everything you're supposed to if you want to do well. Then based on your own experience and comfort level you can adjust your efforts accordingly

Its fine to skip all your pre-readings but you should know what youre getting into - which really depends on the mod and how your Prof teaches it. I myself have skipped pre-readings completely on some mods so its not impossible. Of course I don't expect to top the class but I am pretty happy with my results

1.  What you takeaway really depends on how much pre-reading and post-reading reflection you do

When you read, think about what main points the readings are driving at. Don't delve too much about the specific terminologies and concepts they talk about, especially if you already don't understand or like the course. We are not professionals. We are here just to discuss about these ideas.

I often had to schedule my activities (ie part time jobs, external CCA, volunteering projects) around bids as well, and I have lost opportunities because of bids I weren't sure were going to work out or not :/

If your preassigned clashes with something, you can write to your Office who will generally be nice enough to change it for you to a slot that works :)"
Henry-of-Skalitz,1,holy fuck you can get preassigned 5 mods? I got 3 preassigned and bid one. (freshman here as well)
chillingbeer,1,"can take vuca by whitney zhang (ard $10)
heavier workload but cheap mod

not sure if econs need take management comm but can take that too!

climate change is ok too! not so heavy but $$$

hearsay ctrw $$$ and not ez to score bc everyone do damn well hence raise the bellcurve"
Any-Background-7568,1,I thought we can't bid because it is  pre-assigned for freshmen? Pls correct me if I'm wrong
chillingbeer,1,Wrote both 3k on the same week…. brain literally alt tab between both mods content LOL
alvinlin86,1,"Here's a tip, spend 2 hrs a day on the essay about 1 month before deadline. Don't aim to write all 3000 in one seating. Aim for 200-300 a day. Spend more time reading on academic research before putting into words. Then spend the last week before deadline finessing your work. It's a walk in the park when you break it down to small tasks."

chillingbeer,2,Can take LTB if u looking for fluff!
No-Egg-9338,2,"Look for sg50 lol. If u have it in freshmen round, its an absolute steal. Pass/ fail mod with absolutely fuck all to do. And it clears 2 baskets. It's usually 120+, but in y1s1 u can get it for 20+. Don't do SMA. Content wise its not hard cuz its just excel functions and applying them. But most people who take it are yr 3s and 4s who have to do it compulsorily and would have spent some time brushing it up so the bell curve is really high. And also if ur using a mac, you'll miss out big time in finals cuz there's no alt key for u to use shortcuts and so you'll be slower for calculations and stuff.

fluffyAgNeS,5,"With SMU’s course load, students coming from overseas generally find it more intensive and difficult compared to their home country. Normally, it wouldn’t be very feasible to have much spare time for travel. However, if you do plan on coming over, I’d suggest picking modules with a smaller course code number. Like COR1xx or OPM1xx. If you’re able to plan all your modules to the front or back of the week, then you might be able to travel from perhaps Thursday-Sunday. Almost all modules in SMU have project work which contribute to a portion of the grade so that’s another thing to consider as well. For housing, you can check [viable options for housing](https://admissions.smu.edu.sg/international-students/living-singapore). Generally, transportation around Singapore is very efficient and convenient. Food here is decently priced depending on where you purchase from. Feel free to pm me if you have any questions!"
Hopeful_Walrus174,11,This is the wrong country to study in for a light course load and a jumping off point for travelling around SEA. Study is a full time job here not a development opportunity like in the US. Suggest you consider a gap year to travel and explore. Your plan sounds like a waste of your money and your classmates' time.
bigdaddysunshine34,3,"Former SMU student here, have a few friends who took up this program. One piece of advice, DO NOT TAKE THIS PROGRAM. 2 of my friends who got accepted into Cambridge/LSE/US Ivy League schools got sold into this “fast track” program due to the many “benefits” and the criteria was 3.7 GPA needed to be kept in the program. 

They changed the criteria to 3.8 one year later and were promptly dropped from the program (despite having 3.7 GPA). Many students were outraged at the sudden change and appealed to no avail.

DO NOT JOIN SMU IS. You deserve somewhere better."
kekekke22,2,"this year, there were 2 students selected. There is no set number of vacancy, depends on the prof in charge. Usually only top students will be considered (GPA at least need > 3.8)"
eugenetan0,2,"It’s true that only few students make it for this programme. However, only one or two are selected for the SCHOLARSHIP of this programme. If I’m not wrong, you can still pay to join the programme (with a min GPA of course), as per what I heard about some other schoolmates. That’s something maybe u can clarify on and check, just that if you pay for it yourself, the fees are quite exorbitant. 

But from what I’ve seen of the grads from the prog, they get amazing jobs in the US at Bay Area and stuff even now. AWS, Adobe etc. Definitely I’ll say it’s worth it, the CMU brand opens a different league of opportunities"
Fearless-Market-7053,2,"The experience is definitely worth it man. It's hard to get in since its highly coveted, but I suggest you try it anyway since it will really give you a lot of different opportunities"
cxxhts,4,just take 5 if u can!
cknight2020,2,If you take 5 i strongly suggest you ask what is the workload 1st for the mods from seniors. You may drown if you chain heavy mods in a semester. Especially matters if you are a law student or IS student. Not sure abt the other schools.
Blackinksquid,2,"It depends on your objective. If you intend to score then you should try and balance the difficulty of your mods so that you have enough time to dedicate to each mod. Also, it depends on your groups as you may need to ""carry"" poorer team mates which saps time away. I personally go for tougher mods to be ""carried"" by seniors and enter easier mods in later years because the competition is simpler - Y1 tends to have less experience and I have found team mates that I can rely on.

If your objective is speed. Then load up on easier Y1 modules first and do well in them. Find good friends and bid for modules tgt. After which you'll have sufficient experience and the right team to handle the tougher modules in Y3 and Y4."
isleftisright,2,Take more when you are young and have energy. Not joking.
curious_rellevart,1,"I think that is up to you. If you prefer a more relaxed early university life, you can do 4 mods. Also you need to take into account your y3 y4 mods as they might be more intensive so you might want to take 4 mod sems then. This is my own personal opinion though so dont fully take it from me.

If you are already getting such traumas from NTU CS, I wouldn’t recommend trying SMU CS. As for IS, If you hate programming (eg learning python & taking exams on it stresses you out a lot), I would advice against it too. All students have to go through programming, web development, dev ops as fundamentals. You can try NUS BA. It may suit your more. Just my 2 cents :)"

marvelsman,4,"Email the prof to explain, and ask if you can join the class in Week 1.

They are usually quite understanding, and there are people who do this to confirm if they want to proceed bidding for that class."
CallipygianAlien,7,"Class part is what separates the A+s from the As. The extra 1% to 2% is insanely valuable in the long run, considering how smu allows you to overclock the GPA cap of 4.0.

Understand what your professor wants from class part. Quantity or Quality? Some are really lax on quality...

Spend 30mins or so before class to go through the slides and prep any potential answers (eg. obvious blanks in slides) or think about any good qns you can ask on the concepts or examples.

For profs that grade on quality class part, it really becomes a test of critical thinking. Perhaps the easiest way to go about it is to imagine the boundaries of a concept - test the extremes.



!!! LENGTHY EXAMPLE ALERT !!!

For example, you can pick apart the definition of DISRUPTIVE INNOVATION. It comes up a lot in business school.

The term was coined by Clayton Christensen, and describes a process by which a product or service initially takes root at the bottom of a market by being cheaper, niche and simpler—it then relentlessly moves upmarket, eventually displacing established competitors.

Based on the textbook definition (cheaper, niche and simpler), Uber is not considered a disruptive innovation. How can it be said to be a simpler option than taking a taxi or buying your own car? Is it also more niche? It might not be cheaper either.

However, one thing that we can certainly agree on, is that it is disruptive. So disruptive that it spawned a ride-sharing industry.

Bring this up in class, and you would be questioning the very core of the definition of disruptive innovation. This will naturally spawn a class discussion and net you some solid class participation points."
pulinjika,1,Don’t be afraid of looking dumb/asking dumb questions. College is probably the only place you can do that so be confident and speak up. I know most kids at SMU look at class participation as the component that could decide your final grade but avoid seeing it like that. It’s a great learning opportunity.
CallipygianAlien,3,"First off, language mods are cleared under general electives, so make sure you have space for that!

I took Italian in y4s1, and it was a great experience. The professor was very enthusiastic, and learning a new language is rather intellectually stimulating. Granted, it was time-consuming. I had to spend an hour a day on Italian worksheets, and my MRT commutes on duolingo.

Not sure why you're struggling to find reviews. But if you're interested in French, just do it. Doing well in university is far more about self-discipline than how good or bad the prof is anws."
L0J0,1,"Computer science new course you won’t get much help from just your senior alone but from IS, I would say it’s personal preference to program on macs not that it is any better. But using macs will require you to handle configurations on your own sometimes as some profs provide limited support on MAC setup for stuff like web servers etc 

Generally windows computer are cheaper and for the same price you might get a better CPU and RAM which I think that is important? Storage as well because over your 4 years you prolly gonna write a tons of stuff Soo yehhh I had to delete my bootcamp for windows on my MAC to install Kali for Cybersec stuff cause not enough space"
kekekke22,1,MAC
CallipygianAlien,4,"SMU-X mods have a heavy project with a real-life client. Not a big difference to a normal module with high weightage in project work.

Having a real-life client really doesn't mean shit, because your suggestions and ideas are unlikely to be feasible or executable based on their budget or manpower.

At the end of the day, you're still pleasing the professor - he or she is the one who grades you. Even if you do a crap job for the client, if the professor likes your project, their decision entirely overrides the client's sentiment."
superalim,3,Some SMU-X mods also have an insane workload that is similar to doing a mini-FYP.
CallipygianAlien,4,"bid for modules that are pre-requisites to (1) core modules or (2) major core or electives. The latter assuming that you have a major in mind.

The most common suggestion is to get Stats in y1s1. Why? because the price spikes in y1s2 when everyone realises that it is a pre-requisite for many modules. I bid 35 credits for stats in y1s1, and it spiked to 50+ in y1s2. 

Take a look at smumods.com and perform your own analysis to determine if this seasonality exists for other modules.

Planning for mods NOW is critical. You're setting a good foundation for yourself in terms of e-credits management and major selection.

PM me if you have anymore questions, I'll be glad to help you in my free time."

PinkXephos,4,"common ones are BGS, LTB (core mods) cause freshies have a certain number slots reserved for them so it’s better to clear them now. after year 1 you will be fighting with the rest of the school (year 2-4) and it’s gonna cost a bomb to bid."

more importantly, spend ur free time now reading up about finance or marketing and what careers in either industry entails.

edit: the only time that laptop mattered a LITTLE bit was during a module called computer analysis tools (spreadsheet modelling) - quite a lot of excel features are missing in macOS. but you'll get by. ppl still get A+s using a mac."
PinkXephos,2,"photoshop only necessary if you want to do visuals maybe for illustrations purposes i guess but generally not required. the only software i can think of is lock down browser used for certain exams. macbook should be able to tank tho occasionally you can hear the fan spinning loudly hahaha. 

if you are looking into 2nd majors such as soci/psych, they require SPSS software (i think) not sure if macbook can tank but i know windows confirm can. for 2nd majors in IS, prob need certain coding softwares not quite sure but based on my friends macbook is so so for coding, some prefer windows."

superalim,2,"I am currently a Y3 and I will be going for Local Exchange in the following semester. I will be clearing Asian Studies, Globalisation Studies, and IS Options.

I highly recommend you to clear General Education (GE), Asian Studies (AS), and Globalisation Studies (GS) while you are on exchange. Currently, I am still bidding for modules in SMU just in case I don't get what I need in NTU and I realised that bidding for GE, AS and GS is really expensive because IS students cannot bid for them in Round 1. To circumvent this in the event that you choose to take GE, AS and GS in SMU, I highly recommend you to pick a 2nd Major (If you don't have a 2nd Major yet) that will allow you to bid for GE, AS, and GS you want in Round 1. You can drop it after taking the module.

Personally, I feel that it is untrue that it is tough for SIS students to go for an exchange due to a lack of modules/competitive. There are tonnes of Exchange University to choose from and many of them have Computing or Engineering school. 

In regards to your last question, I am going to NTU for Local Exchange and previously offered Seoul National University (SNU) for Overseas Exchange. SNU also offers a lot of courses that can clear AS, GE, GS, and IS Options."

I’m also not so sure in the process but that’s what I did. 

Hope this helps! :))"
FolkeWulf190,4,"Hello! I believe NUS/NTU tfl is applied directly from banks(DBS/OCBC) whereas SMU administers the TFL on behalf of the government. So basically repayment of your tfl will be made to SMU directly after you graduate. If you have already matriculated, you can apply on OASIS self-service apps, under financial aid. After applying, you will receive an email to state wether your application is approved. Once approved, you’ll have to make an appointment at SMU campus with you guarantor to sign the relevant forms. Hope this helps! :)"
jinxedsink,2,"hiii, I wanted to ask, what if I took a tfl but then got a scholarship? Is it possible for that to happen? Or are the chances of getting a scholarship reduced when I take the loan?"
chillingbeer,2,"TFL is directly from the school itself! Just apply and they will ask you for the required documents and (not rly sure abt this sem) when the sem starts, you and your guarantor need to go down to the finance office to sign the papers :-)

interest will start to accumulate after u grad and payment is through school :-)"
EpicBJJ27,1,"Hi! Fellow international student here! As far as I know, I remember the email from SMU stated that we are not to make an appointment with the ICA as of yet."
mhleonard,1,Would you recommend any donor funded scholarship for BBM student?
franticpillow,6,"You can go to Oasis and click on the 'upload photograph' item in the checklist. It should bring you to the photo upload site and if the photo is approved it'll state it there (ie 'photo has been approved' instead of the initial 'pending approval'). 

Also you can probably just upload your verification selfie in the applicant's self service portal so long as the tab is there under the 'upload documents' section and u hv matriculated."

EpicBJJ27,5,">Smuffin is a guide on life in Singapore Management University. We write golden content for free cause we know how much it sucked when we were struggling.
We started off as a humble blog in 2016 educating the student population about pains such as the bidding process for classes.

EpicBJJ27,5,"Hmmm still planning to go to Singapore since it’s going to be mixed learning supposedly. Moreover, I do think I’d have an easier time concentrating on online classes over there than in my house. 

I also do feel safer if I’d be in SG compared to my country during these times. 

Hopefully, I can get a place in PSR. If I do get a place, I’d probably travel to Singapore 14 days before the move in day so that I could serve the stay home notice."
pulinjika,3,Hi! Y4 SOA senior here. Planning to wait and see whether they’re gonna specify if the mods will be online/offline/mixed. Gonna try to bid all online if possible and take off from SG and do next sem at home.
CallipygianAlien,5,"Hi there, I managed to get into the SMU Scholar's programme after the Year 2 Semester 1. I'm from LKCSB. At that point, I had a CGPA of 4.15. It is my belief that there are several pre-requisites for this situation to occur.

1. An existing scholar has to leave the programme. In my case, one of the scholars who got their scholarship in Y1 decided to switch to NUS medicine instead.
2. You need to have the highest GPA in your batch. (you're only fighting with non-scholars of course)
3. At that point, I was also the president of a CCA - so that might have come into play. Not too certain.

I had a couple of peers who managed to get external scholarships as well, but all of them were > 3.9 in GPA. So yea, it's going to be tough."
juinnnao,4,"Getting SMU provided scholarship in Y2 is almost impossible as most are filled in Y1 unfortunately. I know of people who applied but those who do get a scholarship in Y2 are mostly for external scholarships only. But yes, once you apply for a mid-term scholarship, whatever result you use to enter won't matter anymore and only your uni results + cca records etc matter. You'll need to apply it in Jan with your first semester's result. They will subsequently ask for your second semester's result after that. Not too sure about applying as an international student though as most scholarships on SMU's list are limited to singaporeans/PRs only."

EpicBJJ27,5,"Hi! I’m an incoming international student as well! I’ve heard that the applications for PSR would open around early June!

I’m not so sure as to whether or not it is difficult to get a place there, I’ve heard that they prioritize freshmen. 

This is one of my biggest fears but I believe that they have more accommodations but I’m not so sure so you could email them just to be sure. 

If you have anymore questions for PSR, you could always email them psrhousing@smu.edu.sg"
NS1307,3,"Hi, I stayed at PSR this year and I do think they prioritize year 1s since most of the people I met here are freshmen. However this doesn’t mean you’ll definitely get a spot so it’s good to have a backup plan. One y1 girl I met didn’t get offered a spot for term 1 but managed to move in for term 2"

StoneEagleCopy,1,Always worth a shot.

Aranciniballs,2,Did my masters in business management from SMU. How may I help?
tamagoyakisoba,2,Hmm okay. Have you considered other places along the Circle/Downtown line? SMU is a stone's throw away from Bencoolen/Bras Basah MRT.
tamagoyakisoba,1,try seeing if there are HDBs available for rent nearby.
beiz_z,3,"Heyy its definitely ok. In fact it allows you to be more open-minded as you learn more about the different aspects of business. I was the same, i didnt want to take a degree that would be very technical (i dont think im able to commit), e.g. engineering, medicine, law, econs, accountancy etc., so i went with business too. 

At SMU, there are 10 business core modules, which eveyone has to take. These modules are basically introductory modules to the many majors SMU offers, which means you are given abt 2yrs to shop around (take all the intro mods and see what you like to learn more), before you declare your major (latest by yr2 sem2, which is what i did). 

At the same time, as the rest commented, you'll be taking FTW in yr 1 and 2, which are basically career guidance workshops, including appropriate dressing, interviews, resume writing etc.. Every student will also know (if you dont, you should/will by yr 1) who theirndedicated career coach is. They will provide more insights on possible industries/jobs you might be interested in. They are very helpful!! 

So its totally ok to feel lost at yr 1. Heck, i didnt know what i wanted till end of yr 2 (cause i had to declare my major). Actually if you really want to go full on general, you can declare no major too, though i think people rarely do that, but its an option!"
beiz_z,3,"Honestly this subreddit is super dead, you'd get more responses on r/sgexams. 

Anyways, FOC is just the standard orientation camp. Help you make a few friends before you start uni, and hope your faci is in the same faculty as you (so that you can ask for notes HAHAHA). Let you learn how to get around school/what area is called what (e.g. t-junct, big steps, mpsh etc.) You'll also get to try out quite a few ccas e.g. judo, kendo, diving, dragon boat (i think). You'll be doing mostly ice breaker games aside frm it, then theres the finale night. But all in all theres not much diff frm it to other orientation camps you might have attended in the past.

Also please dress according to what your facis tell you, you're not here to show off your clothes. If you arent wearing appropriate clothes when you're at the sports station, you'll be missing out on a lot as you wont be allowed to participate. (I say this cause i've had some girls arrive at sports stations in skirts or low cut tshirts and whatnot.)

Also yes, it will be held in/around school. I believe they are doing it daytime only now, i.e. break camp around 6pm ish, yall will prob go for din tgt, then see each other the next day in the morning 9/10am. Lunch will be catered i believe."

billymyhero,11,"hello, let me bring you through what bidding is like, or what we call ""bidding hell"". SMU's bidding system earns that name because it allocates modules to you through highest bids, so you have to have good credit (e$) management, and know how outbid the general population to get your mod, while not jeopardizing your remaining credits. there are also many cunts who ask for your bids so they can use that information to their own advantage, so that is where many freshman students will get their first taste of how toxic some SMU people can get. i usually just tell though, because i am not a toxic cunt and i am smart enough to manage my credits well.

&#x200B;

you primarily bid for modules through the bidding platform BOSS, which can be found on OASIS, which is SMU's online platform. i highly suggest you bookmark the BOSS page because the webpage locks you out very frequently when you do your bidding.

&#x200B;

since you are a freshman, your first bidding window will happen with ALL other freshmen, so you will only be competing for slots with all other freshmen. i'm not sure when the exact date is, but it is so huge that when the time comes, you'll know.

&#x200B;

as a freshman, depending on your exemptions from some modules and such, you may be pre-assigned 2-4 modules for your first term. on average, for 1 degree-1major, all SMU students have to complete a total of 36 modules in order to graduate, you can expect to be taking 4-5 modules per semester, over 8 semesters.

&#x200B;

at the start of every bidding window, you will be given $100. if you are pre-assigned any modules, a set amount of credits (20$) will be taken from your account, leaving the rest for you to bid for any course you are allowed to bid for. eg. for me, i was pre-assigned 3 modules for my freshman term, leaving me with $40 to bid for other mods. you will only be pre-assigned modules in your first 2 semesters (year 1 students only). your timetable will be solely determined by YOU, depending on the classes you manage to get.

&#x200B;

for every module, there are a few classes \[G1,G2,G3 etc\], and in every class, there are only 45 maximum slots. this is why your bid amount becomes so important, for mods that are not pre-assigned. let's say for a particular mod like marketing (MKTG101) that is not pre-assigned: at the end of the first window, MKTG101 class G1 has 100 bidders. the 45th max bidder is at $20.11, the 46th max bidder is at $20.10. the 46th max bidder and below will not get the mod. however, say now the class G1 has only 40 bidders. in that case, at the end of the window, ALL bidders automatically get enrolled in the class because 45 slots > 40 bidders. in that case, anyone who bidded more than minimum will have lost out on some credits they could've saved if they predicted correctly that the class will not get more than 45 bidders.

&#x200B;

popular modules will often have more than 45 bidders, thus taking more than $20 to get, so you really have to look at historical data (you can find that through a link on the BOSS platform) and your own private information to determine how much you are willing and able to bid for that module. eg introduction to statistics (STAT101) is a very common and popular mod that freshman students take in their first term, so good profs for that mod can take up to $35 in the first bidding window in order to get i.e. you have a good chance of not being the min bid with $35, so you will get the mod. not so popular mods can often be the absolute min bid ($10, which is the lowest amount anyone can bid for a mod), and have many slots remaining after the first bidding window. you have to look at the past BOSS results to know more about what i am talking about. a website you can use to see prof reviews is [reviewmyprof.com](https://reviewmyprof.com)

&#x200B;

there are a few bidding windows for students so if you fail bids in the first window, your failed bid credits will be refunded back to you, you can see what other slots are available left, pick up the pieces and try again. it is a never-ending cycle until you're finally satisfied with your timetable for the upcoming semester. try not to fail bids for popular mods in your first year though, because things will only get more expensive in future windows. you should always try to aim to successfully get your bids in your first window, without spending too much and becoming the max bid (try to get as close to min bid as possible, but not min bid, because then you're treading on thin ice).

&#x200B;

this is all i can think of so far, at the end of the day you're responsible for your own planning and assessment of how much you're willing to bid for each and every mod, with or without friends bidding together with you. you'll get better after you actually experience your first bidding window. if you PM me i'll show you a pic of my past bidding results so you can get a sensing of the details and what each row/column means.

&#x200B;

also, your camp orientation leaders will fill you in more about bidding, but if you've read what i wrote closely enough, this is more than what they can possibly tell you in that short span of time. hope i helped, good luck! :)"
hiepeople,1,Hieee sorry but I just wanted to know when you received the offer
billymyhero,3,"year 2 student, going on year 3 here.

as long as it doesn’t clash, and you think you’re not gonna be tired with it, then go for it! it is one of the easiest ways you can make many friends in SMU, and it doesn’t hurt to make many friends. bidding for future classes in groups/finding a potential co-curricular activity will also be easier. 

many friends will fall off after a while though, something i’m sure you would be able to understand.

have fun! :)"
