either declare and pay for the fridge or don't keep one (like many students without fridges)."

prioriority,48,"Ok serious comment. If you want to know what caused this, point the fingers at ourselves (or more accurately, our seniors from ages past). 

My family member is a teacher. According to her, one of the things that give teachers the most pain is students asking why they did not get the grade they expected. Why do they know what to expect? Because things were too transparent to the point students no longer study to learn, but only to game the system. 

By making things transparent, teacher's options are limited because they can't adjust the marks (usually because their superior is a kookoo and has different expectations for the bell curve and it wasn't communicated beforehand). 

To make things worse, every single query from students just snowballs into hours of work. She is just exasperated at the whole thing and is on the verge of quitting. She would much rather nothing is transparent. Sad reality is that it is a disincentive for teachers to be transparent.

Rant end. Moral of story. Don't be a teacher."

No_Locksmith_1312,7,"Hey there! Whatever you’re feeling right now is totally valid! Currently Y2S2 in MAE as well so I know the struggles that you’re going through! 

Year 1 was very tough on me cos I was freshly out of NS, didn’t prepare for Uni and wasn’t expecting the fast and challenging pace of Uni. 

As for the academics, tbh I would say it’ll only get harder and that’s the reality… But, you Can always prepare yourselves by getting the resources, senior notes, discord etc! There’s a dedicated discord for MAE too! It’s very important to be disciplined and keep up with the schedule timeline of the modules! Or else, you’ll simply fall behind, been there done that! Attending your tutorials and keep asking questions is important as well! Join the PTPs at the start of the sem to acquire important materials as well 

I used to love learning a lot back in poly, and have a passion for it and when I came into Uni, I kinda had an imposter syndrome and question all my academic abilities since I was doing quite badly or like what you said below average for these mods! I was at a very dark place because of this + the lack of friends… I thought I wasn’t cut out for Uni too, there were a lot of times where I wanna drop out haha… but you see the reality is, I had to accept that Uni isn’t poly and the pace, the concepts taught are harder and tougher… I can’t keep holding onto the person I was back in poly and accept that there will be people smarter than me, and people who will do better than me! I also learnt to not compare myself with others because honestly I get nothing out of it, but worries and anxiety haha… just keep on doing you and put in the work consistently! 

I learnt to not rush my learning as well and take some time to understand the concepts and clarify with the profs when needed! Because even if you’re watching the lectures at 2X speed, will you understand the lesson completely? 

As for friends tbh, you have to put yourselves out there! I had only 1 friend back in year 1 and it was very tough whenever I see a group of people walking, talking and having a good time! Now my close friends in MAE were from my lab classes and tutorial groups haha and I love them to death, I’m not an extroverted person, but I had to be uncomfortable and talk to others to make more friends haha

Honestly I can’t convince you to continue, change course or to withdraw, because this is really up to you, maybe advices from other seniors and professors would give you better clarity 

Hang in there, I can’t say for sure that things will get better, but you’ll get used to the MAE rigour, I can’t emphasise how important it is to have a good support system too! Best of luck to you :-)"
HeimlichManure_,2,"I guess the first question you have to ask yourself is what made you want to apply to ME in the first place? I think It is really about what you envisage you want to be in the future and better still if it aligns with your strengths. 

For MAE, it will only increase in difficulty from Y1 and it is a mad rush all the way till Y4. I cannot guarantee you it is going to be better till you have that clarity in your mind. 

In the grand scheme of your life, it is only a year and you still have such a long way to go. Besides, It is not even a year lost. This suffering you feel will definitely strengthen you as a person or it could steer you in another path you feel more passionate about.

From here, I think you can speak to your parents/councillor and most importantly speak to yourself. Take an LOA if need be. If you wish to change course in the end, good luck! If not, I wish you find the people and the strength to surmount this hellacious course. Do let me know if you require some help too (I am ME Y4)"
CloudlessEveningSky,1,"Ok let me gather and list all the fast tips i have : 
- plan your semester well. Balance hard mods with low effort mods, read up course syllabus before planning stars. Not all MAE cores are tough, some requires much less effort to score than the others (also dependent on where ur strengths are at). Like for me i found Manufacturing process and theory of mechanism and engineering graphics all p manageable. 
- focus and prioritise on studying for CAs then catch up with the workload later on. 
- it’s not necessary to have to pay 100% attention to LAMs to be able to do the problems. That’s why most ppl play it at 1.5x and put in more effort to practicing the tutorial problems. Practicing on the concepts and actually applying it helps the most in training your mind to understand the concept. They insert in a lot of derivatives usually that isn’t crucial to know. It’s a lot about speed running through the content and being able to pick out all the key concepts that you need for problems. The content for mech eng can indeed be quite heavy at times, so honestly often times you have no other choice than to speedrun it and jump into application. You can always fill in the gaps through youtube, google, chegg, textbook or revisit the lams.
- mech eng can be quite the leap from JC in terms of technical knowledge. you would be hearing a lot of things for the first time probably, whereas poly counterparts might’ve heard of most things before already. The one advantage JC has is it’s mathematics  foundation training is usually much stronger than poly foundation. So you really truly need to be passionate about mech eng to have a better time in the course. Like for example if you understand why is there a need for you to learn all those MOM equations, fluids, or study control engineering, ur time will be much easier.
- reading up in advance and staying ahead of the game is quite important, be sure to do it when you have the chance. Like for instance finishing week 2’s tutorial in week 1 or even before week 1 starts. The sooner you figure out your problems the easier your journey will be."
Huinker,1,"I got depressed during Y1S2 due to inability to cope with MoM. I also went through what you went through: acad life, social life, self-confidence. I cant say for sure what you should do because I dont fully understand your situation enough. This is what you have to evaluate by yourself.

For myself at least, I tried to bandage my Y1S2 hoping just to get through it. MOM i used [this](https://blogs.ntu.edu.sg/ngbf/ma2001-ay2122-s1/). Then for Y2S1, I tried to do more cca activity like MAE club and took less final exam mods and more project mod and BDE to destress myself. Obviously, this doesnt suddenly turn myself into 4.0 GPA student. For Y2S1, I still got exam anxiety, still faced shitty grade. But it got better for me, I could cope with failure and fear in a better way.

I hope whether you choose to stay in MAE or not, it will get better for you."
DeerIndividual5476,1,"I know a senior who was in a similar position as you- did PMCE i think and then did bio sci w 2nd maj in medicinal chem and pharmacology.

He said that he struggled in bio especially, mostly because he had no prior knowledge. So you'd have to work harder than the average student with bio background for bio mods in general. 

He found the chem mods quite manageable. The main issue is balancing this with your first major, biology. 

What you can do is- you can apply for bio sci w the 2nd major first. If you get accepted take it and see how you adapt. If you're struggling, try to drop your second major by Y1. 

Alternatively, you apply for bio sci single major, then in Y2 you can try to apply for the 2nd major after Y1, assuming your gpa for Y1 is 4.0 or above. Im not sure if this applies for this 2nd major, but it applies to food sci & tech 2nd major."
delilahhhhhhhhhhhhh,1,"hi! I’m a y1 student taking biosci and I was also a PCME student w no bio background at all. you definitely can manage it well if you work extra hard and be v disciplined :-) it’s not uncommon for pcme kids to take this course (heard that there were a handful for my batch), u just got to study harder than the rest to catch up! would suggest you look through some bio concepts before coming so u will be more prepared( etc genetics, physiology) jiayous!"

GutsyGallant,2,"What's your diploma? Generally most tech jobs require you to have a CS degree or minimally a EEE degree since as much as I like to hate on NTU CS, a CS degree does teach you a lot of fundamentals that purely doing personal projects cannot teach you. Some companies like Accenture (I think) accept diploma, and while the pay would definitely be lower and the work environment not as good as big tech firms, it could be a good way to get your foot out of the door.

If you don't have a CS degree, you need to really work on your portfolio to show HR that you have the knowledge necessary to work in this field. And thankfully for CS, there are a wide range of free resources online for you to self study from."

Aggravating-Hope5823,4,"Hi! I took Malay last sem and I really enjoyed it. I have taken other languages before, so I kind of knew how to go about studying for a language mod. I would say the classes are fun and engaging. I was in a very interactive class where I made a few friends, so that helped. My class size was 20. The lecturer was great - she was helpful, charismatic, and paced herself according to students’ needs. It’s nice when the class is small enough for the lecturer to know your name and for you to learn about the other people in class.

I didn’t feel the grammar was all that difficult. As with most languages, the work-intensive part is picking up vocabulary. Some of us had created a word bank to collect all the words that we’ve learned and categorize them. I use pen and and paper in class, so I would note down every new word I heard. Trying to practice with friends helps too. Doesn’t need to be serious, but just a fun exchange of words would reinforce what you’ve learnt. You’ll also realize that the Malay we learn in class is a little different from what the native speaker uses.

I don’t know how it’ll be in the special term.

Hope this helps! Feel free to dm for more info!"

vajraadhvan,3,"If you've taken AB1301 Business Law, you'll know that there are a few structures a business entity can assume, such as a sole proprietorship, partnership, or a corporation. Most financial advisory ""companies"" operate as agencies having fiduciary duties to their principals (insurer or banks), meaning they are not, in fact, corporations. As an FA, you will be self-employed. This already bars FA positions from qualifying as a Professional Attachment by NBS.

As others have said, many finacial advisors have shady organisational structures, recruiting practices, and lead generation tactics. The latter can include making you create a list of all your friends and family members, and then passing those names onto other their FAs.

In addition to not gaining any meaningful non-sales experience, you will also be told to sell suboptimal products, such as life insurance instead of term, or highly illiquid endowments with inappropriate risk/return profiles. Investments magically garner an eternally unchanging x% return YOY, without discussing tail risks like the COVID-19 pandemic (because salespeople don't do mathematics!). What do prime brokers do? What is the market microstructure of SGX? How do you value real options, or build a DCF model? You will get blank stares from FAs.

In addition, you will hear other FAs (or worse yet, your bosses) talk about pseudoscience like NLP (neurolinguistic programming, not natural language processing!) or MBTI to close deals, which is essentially scientific-sounding astrology. You think you won't fall for these, but when Million Dollar Round Table and/or Lamborghini envy kicks in, you will spend all your time brushing up on pop psychology, self-help gurus, and hustling.

TL;DR: If you're okay with the precarity of self-employment, don't care that you're not really contributing much to society and won't get your PA approved, are surrendering your friends' and family's contacts to other FAs, being disingenuous about financial planning, and will be surrounding yourself with sweaty pseudoscience enjoyers, go for it."

eccentric_eggplant,2,"1) 3 year programme and high ranking uni (keeping in mind ranking does not equate to good professors). Nothing else was in my consideration.

3) Lessons are lecture style for one of the semesters, then the rest are all seminar-based. Lessons are once a week, usually 3 hours per lesson. I remember there were a few 4 hours monster lessons. Workload was high for all the semesters, but you grow into it. After the first semester, you should be well acclimated to the workload. I randomly chose my Y2S2 semester for reference and my records showed 104 hours of studying outside of lessons, doing tutorials, doing up notes. It was more than a full time job for me!

5) Yes, and I might be wrong on this, but I think you are equally able to branch out out of audit/tax/accounting between the big 3 unis, which is not particularly much but possible.

2) NTU accountancy is quite competitive, but people are at least superficially nice. There's also the same fair share of freeloaders. Hall is as fun as you are as a person. If you're introverted and prefer to spend your time alone and doing your work, it's not going to be that much more fun than commuting home.

3) No regrets. For me, the degree is the same as what I would have gotten in the other big 3 unis, but I made fantastic friends here and had a blast. YMMV of course!"
ThatCalisthenicsDude,2,"From my back of the envelope calculations, average score should be 22.916, assuming everyone did all their lams and there are no anomalies in the grade distribution. However, that feels a bit too low given that it's an mcq quiz and anyone can just guess answers.

eccentric_eggplant,3,">4) Can very introverted people do well in NTU biz?

Assuming you mean *shy* instead of introverted, still yes. Class participation has always been a part of the assessment, but my observation is that it is slowly becoming a bigger component of the assessment. It's not going to be like in SMU where if you're shy, people can and will talk over you for their own participation, but it's not uncommon to find a class full of people who don't say anything during class.

My unsolicited advice is if you want to do well, be prepared to fight for your 10% to 20% of class participation, because every mark in the bag is one extra that may put you into the next grade after the bellcurving. Don't rationalize that you're shy and therefore you won't fight for it - get over your shyness and fight for it. The hard part is finding a balance between daring to speak up and being an obnoxious person that makes everyone in the class roll their eyes."
Tisukablat,3,"Q1. Not too sure

Q2. By additional major, I assume you're referring to double degrees such as Acct & Biz (ACBS) or Biz & Computing (BCG), those will definitely demand a higher RP than just a single degree in biz.

Q3. NUS business course is one that includes hons. The people that grad without hons are likely those that have done well in their internship and were offered conversion/have a successful startup etc such that they can afford to grad a year earlier without the honours. Hence the higher median salary, even among NUS biz itself, NUS biz w/o hons has a higher median than NUS biz w hons.

Q4. Class participation is a part of your grades. (% depends on the module but it's usually 10-20%) Being introverted doesn't mean you won't score well but it certainly isn't an advantage to yourself if you choose to not speak at all. I would take it as an opportunity to learn to speak up more. It helps a lot in securing internships or any opportunities that may come your way 

Good luck with your application!"
Informal_Whole_3879,1,"4. It is hard for sure since you may already know by now from the comments, that the class part is a huge component. However, you can still excel. From personal experience, I have never done class part voluntarily, it is either the prof calls my name to answer, or else I would never raise my hand to class part. And I think that is perfectly alright too. If you take business, I am sure you will have a Business Law module, a module that everyone will snatch for class part. I never class part in all of the 12 weeks and I still got a decent grade. I heard from seniors that profs will reevaluate your class part points and still give you a passing grade for the class part components otherwise it reflects badly on them. So not to worry, I understand if you are introvert because I am one too. Though you are on the losing end, at the same time you're not really too. Goodluck!"

boredtomybones,2,"3.48 has a very low chance of getting an offer. 3.37 is the 10th percentile in the 2022/2023 IGP, but in the 2021/2022 IGP, the 10th percentile for ME was 3.49. It's not all doom and gloom, as you said, you still have two more semesters to improve. If you could raise it to 3.65, I'd say you already have half a foot in.

Anyway, a poly student's CGPA number alone does not really determine his/her admission chances; your actual grades do. If you have many A's/A+/Distinctions but two or three C's/D's that pulled you down, you could still have a CGPA of 3.50 and get an offer. Although, it's fair to say, the higher your CGPA, the more A's/A+/Dist you'd have gotten.

However, if your grades are mostly B's and C's, then it will depend a lot on how many people are enrolling in ME the same year as you and how well they performed. If you are a male, you have two extra years to attempt to apply. Not sure about ABA, but it might only help if you have something worthwhile to write.

chubbypun643,6,"Booked mine in September. In the vast majority of cases, if you get the exchange from GEM Explorer, the partner university will accept you. It's true that tickets will be more expensive closer to the date, but you also need to note that you may not know your final dates until much later - so any post-finals plans will need to be planned around your ticket dates - maybe booking the tickets later will give you so more time for that. 

Have you looked into student SQ tickets? They're slightly more expensive, but they are usually cheaper than flexible ticket classes on other airlines. That way you can at least get one date change for free. 

Alternatively, buying 2 one-way tickets can get you even more flexibility, especially with the delayed choice of a departure airport and date (I know open jaw tickets exist, but that's missing the point here).

LLRLRLR,8,"Direct entry to y2 now is nt as stressful as b4. Currently under the new curriculum direct year 2s do their internship during the summer break so u on avg take perhaps 1 mod less.

Anecdotally the avergae y2 students takes about 17-18 Au per sem as comapred to 20+ Aus for the old direct year 2 batch. Could be wrong on this.

Ultimately where all poly students usually suffer is the pace, academic rigour and nt so strong foundations in mathematics. So might wanna brush up on that beforehand"
skystrifer98,5,"From what I've heard the main difference is the PI(Professional Internship) will be done during the holidays for direct y2 so the AU per sem is much more spread out now compared to previously where they were cramming in 20+ AU per sem. Mods wise, some mods recently have been reduced from 4AU to 3AU such as semicon, digital electronics and analog electronics, and while most mods have remained the same, there have been some changes to the curriculum such as Electrical Devices and Machines (EE2005)  which replaced signals and systems. If you're worried about the workload of direct y2, you can always opt for y2 then extend ur candidature to 4 years and OTOT spread out the AU requirements of the course"
Vegetable_Ad_2768,1,It depends how well you did in your EEE course in poly (assuming direct y2 is from poly). I took direct y2 with average of 24c per sem and it was okay (provided i dont have any CCAs and hall activities etc) and basically mugged my way thru uni. Downside is that i am burnt out after graduation and needed some time to get back on track.

ccs77,41,"What's the context and what's the point you are trying to make?

I'm not sure if you know, ntu is one of the most cut throat universities in the world in terms of hiring their academic faculty. That's the reason you don't see many Singaporean professors because many don't make the cut. Alot of their kpi depends on quality research output which includes publishing in top tier journals. Thats the reason why the university is able to do well in rankings, because of the faculty.

Once word leaks out and travel to the school admin, they have to be on caution and also warn you to keep the peace.

I would say if your partner is indeed male and you bought him to your female dorm, it is rather inconsiderate of you for the other dorm mates esp because of all the hidden camera fears in NTU/NUS nowadays.

Perhaps even try Australia, Hong Kong etc. if it makes sense for your background. In NTU, there will be those 5 kids in your cohort, who want to do Math, pure or applied. The rest got in because they didn't get anything they wanted to do and may be just wasting their time in unproductive pursuits. If NTU and NUS were in a bigger country, NTU Math program will be 100 places behind places behind NUS. NTU admissions staff and profs. also know this very well. So, please don't get intimidated. If you get in, and keep being sincere and serious about doing Math, you will still sail through and get a good shot at working on a good project, research with a prof or lab, apply for PhD, job etc. Therefore, if they see you seem serious enough in your application, you will get in.

OMSCS is of no use if your aim is doing research and going onto a PhD later. Why? Because OMSCS doesn’t give you the one most valuable thing that gets you into PhD programs: publications (or research experience, at least). All you do in OMSCS is watch videos (aka doing 10 MOOCs) and get a piece of paper.

That being said, MSAI is a non-subsidised course, so it costs about $40k, which is really honestly not worth it for a piece of paper. From my experience in another NTU MSc program, the dissertation/project for coursework masters is not very substantial and is more like a literature review, which also isn’t very helpful for getting into research.

If you really want to do research/PhD, research MSc is what you should look at. Or just apply directly to PhD. The GRE is not difficult and the maths is about A-level standard, you can self study with online resources for free (or at least very cheaply). When I did my GRE in 2021, I studied maths for 2 hours and English for 20mins, scored a 166V/163Q which easily clears NUS/NTU’s minimum requirement."

swjs00,10,"Hey, fellow EEE undergrad here. Took EE6108 last sem. Whether or not it is a bad idea depends on what your goal of taking the MSc mod is. For me, it was to see learn about computer networks at a depth deeper than undergrad, to learn what MSc curriculum is like, and whether or not I could handle MSc workload.

Lemme share with you a little more, based on my experience in EE6108, but feel free to ask more questions.

MSc mods are different from undergrad. They cover topics alot faster and you need to do alot of independent self-study before and after class. There is also no tutorials. You have to pick questions out of the textbook to practice yourself. But you can consult the profs just like in undergrad.

Like undergrad, MSc mods have assignments and quizzes. In EE6108, there was a team based project as well. The assignment is much, much tougher than undergrad assignment. The assignment questions cover beyond what is covered in the lectures and textbook. E.g. EE6108 is a computer network mod, but the assignment questions were very heavy on algorithms, so I had to read up from NUS CS 2k and 4k mods to do the questions. It was challenging, and fun because I learned something new, which was what I wanted. But dont expect it to be a walk in the park. Its more like trying to hide from a serial killer in the park.

As for team based project (in EE6108. Might be diff in ur 6k mods), its similar to an undergrad team based project in terms of scope, but you are expected to deliver more in a shorter time. An issue I faced is the language barrier. I am a Singaporean, but almost all the MSc students who took EE6108 were native Chinese. Fortunately, I had an Indonesian teammate who I could at least converse with. The team based project was hell trying to communicate with the Chinese. This certainly wasnt what I expected. It might be different for the 6k mods you want to take, but I just want to give you a heads up in case language might be a potential issue for you.

I personally feel its a good idea if you want to do MSc, or youre a masochist in general. If you are looking to pull your GPA up, taking a MSc mod is the worst decision you can ever make. I got a B+, so it pulled my GPA down. Another undergrad who took it as well got B-. While it pulled down my GPA, I have no regrets because I met my objectives. You have to decide what yours are and if it is worth the GPA risk, because in the MSc mods, you are not given any leeway as an undergrad student"

waterfall88888,1,"3. Lectures are pre-recorded so can OTOT before you do the seminar qns before seminars. Most cases, it’s once a week for each module but can vary between 2-4 hours per lesson (for 4 hour lessons, my profs try to keep it within 3hr - 3.5 hr max, w breaks in between)

6. Overseas exchange is possible but accounting degree has more restrictions in terms of the module you can take overseas so you might not be able to map as many core modules as you wish (as compared to other degrees) but you can still clear electives overseas

7. I guess that differs from Hall to Hall, and whether you actively participate in Hall.

8. If you are sure about accounting career, SMU has more exemptions for ISCA. But I still chose NTU because of other personal factors but I don’t regret due to hall life.

CloudlessEveningSky,1,"Did you actually meant to ask for opinions on whether is it doable and your GPA will take a hit instead? Rather than a planning question.

I've only cleared MA2005 and MA3010 before, and these two mods are quite doable though it definitely requires effort and practice. For me MA2005 was much more manageable than MA3010 in terms of effort needed to score. MA2005 is mainly about practicing your hand drawings over and over, like projected drawings, isometric view drawings, true length diagram, etc. And you also need to understand the maths and concepts behind GD&T (tolerancing). For MA3010 I found it much more challenging than MA2005, as it is a closed book final and yet it is a content heavy mod since it spans 2 major topics, Thermodynamics and Heat Transfer, I found myself having to memorise lots of equations on top of having to practice concepts. But definitely taking 3010 is a much better deal than having to take 2007 and 3003.

I think 19-20AU of workload is doable, cuz iirc Direct Year 2 students have a workload that is constantly on par with that. Its just how much GPA you think you can sacrifice if things can hypothetically go south depending on your capabilities, if you load it in this manner isn't it.

As for the extended sem and job part as mentioned by the other comment, you can always just find some decently good excuse like wanting to slow down your studies because you found the pacing to be too fast, or you went and work part time to supplement your allowance, etc. In the long run I honestly don't think extending by a sem will matter down the road, doubt most people will care about it in future."

If we really want to put the pressure on, go to social media about it. Anything that would make the Uni look bad in the eyes of the public would have an immediate and harsh knee jerk response. We would then start seeing emails being sent out to all students and staff about it. If they don't clamp down, we will at least get clarification that proselytising is allowed (or not) on campus.

I'd suggest avoiding the mod if your foundation in Engineering Math 1 EE2006 (Prof Patricia math where you learn all about statistics and probability) isn't strong. So far we've covered topics like expectations, probability distribution functions, likelihood models, MAP, MLE, MMSE, mixture models, EM algorithms, Markov chain, hidden Markov models, sampling and MCMC.

Fenalis,41,Considering how lax the CS curriculum was structured in NTU…
swjs00,26,"It boils down to the difference in curriculum and the students themselves.

Firstly, NTU SCSE curriculum is no where as intensive as NUS SOC's one. Not only does SOC offer more modules than SCSE, SOC's foundation modules like discrete structures and data structures and algo are much tougher. I think a while back, there was a comparison between SCSE's midterm and SOC's tutorial paper, and people pointed out that the latter was tougher than the former. Ive attempted some of SOC's tutorial questions myself, and boy are those really though.

Secondly, the quality of the students that enter SCSE and those that enter SOC are vastly different (generally speaking). Many SOC students already have prior NOI/IOI/IMO experience, startup experience and/or experience with OSS. SCSE has only a handful at best (from what I can see). Imo, SOC students' computing culture is also much stronger than SCSE's too."

misstitiania2,4,"econs with second major in business undergrad here. took this combi bc i thought econs and biz were quite a complementary pairing and versatile enough to open more doors. studying for 4 years (econs) instead of 3 (biz) means losing out on the graduate salary for one year, which is something that you might wanna consider.

for econs, you’ll really have to love math (calculus) and be good at it to survive for 4 years. i loved the intuition behind economic theories, but math not really, and that’s how i suffered haha. i scored A for H1 math but tbh i still struggled to get past those math heavy mods, like HE1003 (math for economists), HE2001 (intermediate micro), HE3002 (game theory). these are old course codes btw, not sure what’s the new course codes now.

especially with the syllabus revamp (more compulsory econometrics+math courses/ downgrading of less math intensive mods from HE4xxx to HE3xxx), it seems like ntu econs is increasingly focusing more on math. there’s def still math-light modules like HE3003 (chinese economy), or courses with more comprehensible math involved (HE3007 financial econs, HE3014 economics of corporate finance), and you could even substitute some econs mods for interdisciplinary math-free MPEs, or take the math heavy mods during exchange as a quick solution…but ultimately somewhat somehow you will still have to deal with a certain amount of math. so manage expectations yea.

(ps: all course codes mentioned above are the old outdated codes, they recently did a revamp so you’ll have to dig for the new course codes. ntu econs has their own webpage that includes courses descriptions in pdf for all courses offered, which you might want to check out.)

biz wise, can’t comment much bc the second major curriculum is pretty watered down - you don’t even get to specialise iirc (at least for my cohort). but i do feel that biz mods in general are more practical and applicable than econs mods with regards to the corporate landscape. had some funny interview encounters where the interviewers (who also studied econs) and I had a great time talking about how the calculus we learnt in school had little to no use in a corporate setting.

two cents hope it helps!"
eccentric_eggplant,5,"Accountancy graduate here. Accountancy is not math heavy at all, other than the sprinklings of general math mods like calculus, etc. The most difficult thing you'll have to do math-wise is probably square and square root, and that's just because they're part of the formulas you're given. 

Accountancy is all about logic and being able to track how money flows where. It sounds really easy, but it's not when you get into the nitty gritty and consider monstrous company structures and accounting policies.

I personally find it very interesting because of the underlying logic, and I recommend you to find out more about it!"

CupMoist5030,2,"Hi, currently a year 1 ntu double deg student - Acc and Biz (ACBS)

1. NTU acc has the longest history and is reputable (I feel among older folks), not much  difference to the younger audience though
2. 6-7 Mods every sem, comparing to my SMU friends who have more exemptions, i find it more rushed but is still manageable
3. anything linked to tech has higher starting salary lol
4. in accountancy you compete with accountancy and ACBS students, so no, ACBS students study for a living and will eat the lazy accountancy students alive"
foodisparadise,1,"Hey! Congrats on ur results, here’s my answers as a final sem Acc student: 

1. Went to NTU b/c NUS is more of a “general studies” sort of thing, I think it’s called business administration rather than Accountancy. Plus, NTU has a better reputation of handing out scholarships. 

2. If you want to achieve a high GPA through sheer means of working hard, my personal thought is that the workload is quite heavy. For year 1 students, accounting-core slides can be upwards of 60, 70 pages. 

3. I think the ACDA program sounds good, probably have a higher starting salary since, like others mentioned before, there is the tech element to it. But heard that the math is quite tough, you’ll be learning things like discrete math plus more complicated things. Know someone who took FMath in JC and admits that the “DA” courses are no mean feat. Another thing to consider is that ACDA program is around 5.5 years iirc. 

4. General consensus is that there is a higher probability to obtain a better grade in Accountancy than say, Business in NTU. Because Accountancy is more difficult = ppl make more mistakes = bell curve helps you out. But if you’re comparing between NTU or NUS, not sure whether there’s a meaningful connection to make for these 2 programs in 2 very different unis

When I got the scholarship, got the impression if you have the grades you would get the scholarship.

As a nanyang scholar you can expect
1) coverage of tuition fees
2) monthly allowance of 560/650 dollars(I forgot which one)
3) Hall coverage of 2000 dollars a year( I am staying in one of the cheaper halls so I top up a couple of hundred dollars per year)
4) Priority for exchange and iirc 5000 subsidy cap for exchange
5) no bond 
6) need to maintain gpa over 3.5( not very hard, just need to keep pace with schoolwork),no cca commitment requirement though you might want that to secure hall

I got the scholarship in 2019 so the terms of the scholarship may have been updated! But the general benefits/requirements should be the same I think."

1. Look at the different mods and their description in the course catalog. 
2. Look through the prerequisites (to see if you have the skills needed for the mods), the course description (to see if that is something that might trigger your curiosity), and the work load (to see if the mod suits your study style)
3. Dont be afraid to approach the prof to ask for more details if the information on the course catalog is insufficient.
4. Talk to your seniors about the mods that they take, why they took it, and if they have regrets. Their feedback can help you plan your own path. They might even share with you their mod materials, so you can see in greater detail if that is what you want.
5. If you have time, you may want to read up further on the topic (e.g. through textbooks, MIT OpenCourseWare etc).

In my case, I didnt have to think much because I already know from the get-go what I want. I feel that you should put in serious thought into what you want to specialize in because it will affect your career path"

Upsides being yes, you can be able to broaden your scope of biological sci and psychology and have higher chances of taking higher level courses from both sides (well at most those with XX2XXX  or XX3XXX mods) due to prerequisites. Plus for those who don't like/unsure of bdes, double major is good. Plus, more broader in terms of career search too!

Downside is they tend to have higher weightage compared to single majors so you have to work doubly hard. Also, most double majors set aside a lesser composition of BDE AUs, meaning to say you cannot explore a lot more other BDEs outside SBS and Psychology. This also means that you cannot do a minor.

Don't restrict yourself too much - I know of people who wrote about religion/ jesus in their essay and got the nanyang scholarship (i've heard it's almost guaranteed you'll get this if you have top tier grades aka 90rp or if you're from poly, the diploma merit award, and that they don't go out of their way to even ask difficult questions in the interview - but don't take my word for it or quote me). If you have something you are passionate about that drives you (aka religion or beliefs about life or whatever) you could write about that and connect it to how it makes you a driven/ motivated person and how it drives you to achieve things etc. 

Key is to present yourself as a successful/ driven + maybe to an extent well-rounded kind of person, but the contents of the essay itself (ie what drives you). 

I'm not sure if this helped but feel free to dm if you need to ask anything else!"

Cuz it sounds like u have spent a lot of time trying to do new activities in school on top of studying daily, sounds like quite the busy life. Or perhaps you might even be burning out. 

With respect to the making friends part, it’s also really about the quality time than the quantity imo. Try focusing on those few ppl u rly wanna make friends with and make an effort to hang out and study with them. Relationships with ppl requires effort and investment too, it’s not over night. 

I think it’s really important that you consider taking time out to find yourself again and see what are your goals, so perhaps u can be more motivated to work towards it. All the best."
BookkeeperNo2865,5,"Enough or not is for you to decide, I think you should set your goals and work towards it. Aiming for good GPA? Study hard, ask questions, take notes. Want to maintain friendships? Go out with them, enjoy uni life abit. 

Uni is a place where you'll discover yourself more, and the things you want to achieve. There's no hard and fast rule to live uni life. And considering the fact that you got a good GPA, just keep working at it if that's what you desire!

Anyways, there's no need to make many friends in uni, quality > quantity. Find some good friends and stick with them. A good clique can boost morale which will be good for mental and academics.

Try to take things easier in year 1 while you get used to the workload.

1. Stop comparing yourself to others
2. Only people with good grades will be constantly ‘flexing’ them.  You never hear about struggling students’ grades… wonder why.  Remember your sample might be biased
3. You usually need time to get used to university if you’re in a social science course, and especially if you have no prior experience.  You’ll get better with time and practice
4. Adjust your expectations - instead of aiming for a first class (which seems far away for now), try fixing your study habits one by one and see gradual improvements
5. Build a sustainable, productive (for you) study schedule that lets you get work done but leaves you enough time for yourself (discipline, not motivation)

dimen1004,11,"Here's a sob story for you then:

Screwed up GPA since y1 right off the bat. Y1S2 due to COVID, manage to pull up. Right after that sem, GPA go down until like crazy. Y3 realize GPA cannot get honors, panic, stress, try my best to pull up by :
- time management
- trying to revise / consolidate the week's worth of content
- even if I don't attempt the tutorials first, I at least read it so I know what the prof saying 
- just thick skin pester the prof until I clarify my doubts 
Though in the end it didn't pull up that much for that acad year, but by last sem Y4S1 I'm close to getting back my honours title. Plus I had essentially no friend support cause snakes so yeah.

Tldr, it's not too late to do something about it. There is no point comparing because it just makes you feel like sht > demoralised > less likely to focus on what's important which is pulling Ur GPA up > GPA drop. So u basically self sabotaging. Just focus on urself, build Ur portfolio also during summer/ winter break since by now you'd already know Ur honors class probably only guarantees Ur success by a not very big margin. It doesn't even give u 50% chance of confirm can get job when u grad if Ur resume is sht. Good luck."

you will still be billed for the entire month (you will see this on your invoice), and then a refund for half the fees will be given at the end of the semester.

this was true for a year back, i am not sure if the policy has changed so - best to ask servicenow agent regardless.

hope this helped!

tldr: pay full month first, then you may receive a refund for half a month depending on when you withdrew."
imntusenior,4,"Yes, pro-rated rates will be returned to you, down to the day. 

So every day is worth 1/28 x (monthly fee) for Feb.

For me & my friends, we didn't use ServiceNow but did everything hall related via contacting hall office on their office emails.

It does take some time for them to refund you though, so if your withdrawal reason is financial-related and the entire sem's hall fees have been paid, it will take awhile before it gets refunded."

Whacksteel,4,"You'll get emails from housing office regarding the dates on when to move in/out. If you decide to stay over the summer, you'll get to keep your room. If you do decide to move out, you'll have to reapply for a room. You could specify a particular room and roommate (for double rooms), but there's no guarantee that you'll get your choice. Back when I was a freshie, y1/2s are guaranteed rooms, but I'm not sure what the policy is like now."
imntusenior,1,">I want to know a couple of things: - 

>when do we have to move out of hall in sem 2 

Not during sem 2, that's for sure. Sometime after the finals ended, and before hall orientations. Usually absolute latest move-out date is late July (for all the halls I've been in, at least). You will get an email about this.

>when do hall applications open 

You will get an email about this

>when do decisions for hall usually come out

After you apply, before move in dates (usually about 2 weeks before sem start for seniors. You will get an email about this

>what kind of options are we given when applying for hall (like can we mention a specific hall or only room preferences)

Hall preference and type of room preference + any indicated roommates, if I recall correctly.

>how likely am I to get the same hall in y1 and y2

Depends on popularity of your hall, nothing is guaranteed, otherwise all the seniors stay 4 years same hall alr. Exceptions if you're in hall JCRC or are in hall rec list... those guys get what they want."

MightySavier,1,Nervous for?
vajraadhvan,2,"In this case, you'll usually need to contact the exchange school; you might be able to start by emailing the relevant OGEM email address.

Undergraduate office admins will follow a strict set of criteria to waive prereqs, and they will generally not be able to gauge whether you will be able to cope with a certain course (they are, of course, not experts in computing). SCSE tends to be stricter re: prereqs.

It might be best to contact the equivalent module's course coordinators directly, asking them to confirm that you have met the prereqs outside of NTU (eg through self-study), and forwarding this as justification to the exchange school. Be warned that SCSE mods are quite oversubscribed, so course coordinators may not be the most contactable — you can try office hours if you're desperate."
clkman,12,"At the rate things are going, i suggest you start finding an internship now"
eccentric_eggplant,5,"1. My limited field of view makes me think most go on to their first job. Only some go for further studies.

2. Your specialization, business admin, or any related fields. How far your related field is to your major will depend on luck of course! I know someone who went into compliance from accountancy. You will likely work for financial institutions or big 4 depending on what you choose as your first job, but again anything between SME and MNC is also fair game depending on your choice.

4. No, there are overseas exchange opportunities. I don't think it's as limited as a 4 year programme (but I say this as someone who didn't bother researching on this part), just how much you want it, whether you fit their criteria and how many people in your cohort are also interested."
678875,2,"1. I believe there’s a mix, depends on your priorities. There aren’t any rights or wrongs.

2. Business is a rather general degree, this can largely be dependent on your specialisation. However, what you eventually do may or may not be related to what you have studied. Unless you are looking to join a very technical field like engineering, medicine etc. what you study does not limit what fields and companies you can work in. You have to decide for yourself, your degree does not decide that for you.

3. Yes, competition for BnF is very high. There are limited slots. To have a higher chance of getting in, you need a B+ and above in FM to get into BnF. If you’re worried, just do your best and try to get an A in it.  

4. It’s rather difficult to match modules, so if you’re looking for a semester exchange it’s rather difficult. If you’re just looking to experience studying overseas and whether or not you can exchange your mods doesn’t really matter, you can try winter or summer studies."
GrandChimp937,1,"1. Up to you. Most won't further studies

2. Business is a general degree, even after specialising (bnf for me), you can pretty much do anything you want for work.

3. It's not as competitive as people make it out to be. I know many who got B for the prerequisite mod and still got into banking and finance

4. Just need to get decent grades. Same as every other course. (I was placed into an exchange program to France but COVID ruined it)"
SteelSW,1,"1. From what I've heard and been advised, go for jobs since further studies usually expect one to have around 3 years of work experience prior to studies. Personally I'm also going for 3 years of working into graduate studies.
2. This depends massively, you have social jobs like Marketing and HR to more technical jobs like Investment Banking and Risk Analyst, each company usually needs some of each so expect the usual Big 4 Accounting Companies (yes they hire business graduates as well).
3. It's by far the largest and most popular specialization. There are of course limited seats, but usually even people who don't fulfill the prerequisite of a B+ in AB1201 Financial Management (like a B- or B) get in as well through appeals.
4. Can't speak much on this, the only other person I know who has done overseas studying is my Year 3 Accounting and Business (takes 4 years) roommate and they were on the Dean's List 2 semesters ago."
Infinite_Tank_6659,1,"1. generally, we go for jobs immediately after graduation, either from conversion during our summer internships or graduate programs. further studies is definitely a viable option, but imo only after few years of a FT job. 

additionally, we take other “further studies” in the form of professional certifications like CFA

2. This depends on your specialisation, if you choose B&F your choice of companies are basically banks, either regional banks (e.g OCBC DBS UOB), bulge bracket (e.g Goldman, JP Morgan, Credit Suisse, Citibank, Bank of America, Morgan Stanley, Barclays, UBS, Deutsche Bank). 

Other popular options are also elite boutiques and hedge funds etc

Your roles at this companies can vary from Private banking, investment banking, corporate banking etc 

3. From personal experience, getting into B&F is not the hard part, you just need a B+ for Financial Management to be eligible. you can appeal if you fail too.

the hard part about B&F is the cutthroat competitive nature, and “snakes” who pull people down to be better. job search might also be extra competitive compared to other fields and specialisation since only the top few get good internships/job offers. 

4. Exchange programmes are open to B&F students, but just remember when you’re in Amsterdam studying, your peers are earning 5 figs in their IB role because they sacrificed going overseas studying opportunities. that’s how it works here."
Joe5443,2,"Should be no issue. I was left with a balance 1AU of GERPE, but got allocated a 3AU GERPE to fulfil that 1AU"
Glittering-Slip1013,2,"1. Its just a pass/fail but the likelihood of failing is really close to 0 unless you really screw up very badly
2. You can self source potential employers for your internship but its subjected to the school's approval on whether they meet the requirement. Alternatively, you can apply through careeraxis for an internship (these are usually pre-approved employers)"

Outrageous-Count6744,11,"Of the 3 i think place is the safest option and less likely to make you cringe over your writing. I think its ok if you dont know the place as there doesnt need to be personal experience.

Try going to a boring place, everyday place like a park. Less activity can be good as you need to tie your observations together into one common theme, and more activity could be distracting/overstimulating. 

Also blog 1 isnt super important so dont be too worried! I ended up not using any of my observations from blog 1 at all. As you go for more tutorials and receive feedback you will get a better idea of what your tutor wants."
trash_0panda,5,"Honestly do place - as for descriptive only your first/second paragraph needs to be descriptive. After that its just the analysis of sources/sources. Then for question just find the anomaly. Descriptive yeah - use 5 senses. e.g the leaves fluttered down from the trees (sight) as i walked past by, the cacophony of children shrieking, birds chirping and rustling leaves greeted my ears (sound). The fresh sea breeze and the tantalising smell of a bbq nearby made me realise _____ (question + smell).

Whacksteel,1,"Hi! Without a topic, I can't give you much specific advice. I can only give you some general advice:

1. Describe adequately, but don't overpower it. Use one (or a few) suitable adjectives that comprehensively convey meaning. Don't delve into the whole five senses with emotion and whatnot. A thesaurus would be good for this.

2. When writing opinions, substantiate them. There needs to be some basis for an opinion, and it shouldn't come from someone else's opinion. Try to find research to base your opinions on. Even better if the research has been replicated. You don't need to describe the research in detail; just ""according to so-and-so, something was found to be like that"" will suffice. Avoid overusing technical jargon; an op-ed should allow the layman to read and understand your opinions.

Am a y4 student so I haven't done any of the cc mods, but I'm in cohass so I do write quite a lot of reports if that helps. Feel free to dm me if you need any help (or proofreading/writing)!"
Significant-Risk6591,1,"For me, I think it's important to choose a topic you are good at or interested in, the writing and all can improve (you have a whole semester to keep editing it) and i think the workload for this cc is the most manageable as it's really spread out over the weeks?For me, I chose something about arts and censorship as it is a topic I'm interested in and also easy to engage with classmates (for presentation portion later on)... So if you're interested in films? write about films, gaming- can talk about youth gaming and stuff! The topic is really more impt and it helps u with being more interested in a cc mod haha ! jiayou~"
Crucinine,1,"Just choose a nearby place (like the park below your house), talk about it and exaggerate every sense (sound, sight, smell most important) to the point you can imagine them vividly (eg. the leaves beneath my feet crunched….). Your first blog is ungraded and might not even be read by your tutor so don’t fret too much. Choose any place near you and start from small details, then work your way through slowly.

As long as your assignments are reasonably done, you’ll do fine. I put in minimal effort and the feedback from my assignments told me my op-ed needed a lot of improvement, plus I kind of bs-ed my way through presentation and still got a B+. You’ll be fine putting in less effort than your core mods"
678875,1,"honestly, I did writing style because I didn’t really wna sit and observe a place. my pointers were really shallow too and it revolved around one observation. are you aiming high for an A or are you just looking to scrape by and pass? if it’s the latter, don’t overthink and just write something. sitting and stressing about it will only make things worse. you can write drafts and get opinions about it. shallow pointers can still make good essays as long as you are willing to develop it."
aiyowheregotlah,1,"blog 1 is really chill. don't worry too much about it.

my advice, just choose a random place in singapore and write about it, it's comparatively easier than community and writing practises. you just have to talk about observations using your 5 senses.

so choose any place in singapore which you like and just start writing

Cytokine-Alpha,6,"NTU Y4 student here. Former DBMS student from RP. 

NTU's core courses are relatively tame and you could probably do decently well in virtually all science-based core modules compared to some of NUS' core modules. 

Outliers include:
- Biophysical Chemistry: Y2 (Formerly Y1S1 Module) that covers quantum physics and Ideal Gas laws.

This module is particularly brutal to Polytechnic students with no physics background. The first few lectures would cover concepts that are far more difficult than A Level Physics. This was my lowest scoring module: C+

- Coding Modules: Data Science and Python: Y1S2, Y2S1~ which covers two machine learning languages; Python and R. 

These modules are quite fun if you're fully immersed in them but they can take a considerable amount of time to learn and can become a timesink if you are not well versed in coding. 

Outside of these three modules, all other Core and Major PEs seem to be very manageable in my experience in NTU with a bit of finesse and revision. You will find that people in both NTU and NUS are competitive, but in my personal experience the NTU SBS community is friendly enough to help each other out."

yu--no,5,"Y3S2 IEM student here, currently doing my internship as a Software Engineer.


Potential job and internship opportunities include software engineering (web, game, etc.), data engineering and analysis, electrical/electronic engineering, advertising, product design, etc.. IEM graduates, compared to the average  NTU graduate, have higher than average employment rates and monthly salaries (mean and median). Most recent MOE data found [here.](https://www.moe.gov.sg/-/media/files/post-secondary/ges-2021/web-publication-ntu-ges-2021.pdf)


Not *too* familiar with the current IEM curriculum (I enrolled in 2020 and there was a bit of a syllabus change halfway through my tenure), but the modules in my syllabus can roughly be divided into 70% Electrical/Electronic Engineering, 20% Computer Science/Engineering, and 10% Art, Design, and Comms -- with some overlap here and there in the case of some modules.  


The syllabus being more broad means that it's a great place to explore and get a feel for your options. This however also means that a bit of *depth* is sacrificed -- which means that you'll need to fight harder for positions against people in degree programs that specialize more heavily in whichever field you choose.


Ceteris paribus, a CompSci student will always be preferred to an IEM student in a software engineering job, an ADM student will always be preferred to an IEM student in a design job, etc.


So if you already have an idea of where you want to go in life, I'd strongly recommend going for a more specialised degree program. Otherwise, you'll need to get an edge over people by doing supplementary learning and projects on your own, or building a bigger/more impressive portfolio than other people.

Browsinginoffice,5,"maths in CS is just basic application of knowledge and its the same as what we did in secondary school and poly tbh and you can improve by just grinding questions

maths major is where you have to proof the formula which is a major step up"
gabrielhsu1997,3,"Math at a university level is very different from secondary school (especially talking about as a a major, single or otherwise). The focus is on abstract understanding, logical reasoning, and building upon a system of understanding (Math courses and prerequisites are very heavily structured). They will teach you everything you need to know, starting from first principles, especially so for Calculus.

Don’t worry, I had poly friends in my courses too! From my experience studying together with them, the modules/concepts they struggle with are more towards linear algebra, logic (take a look at Foundation of Mathematics course outline), combinatorics, and complex numbers. Most of them actually find calculus to be the more manageable area. Because of these areas of difficulty, all of them avoided specialising in pure or applied mathematics, and they’re all happily data scientists in various fields now (which I always tease them about, seeing how much they hated coding in Y1).

Mathematics and CS is a great double major and very synergistic in my opinion, if you’re interested in the two, go for it! Don’t let a fear of your ability stop you, because honestly TAs, seniors and the culture in Mathematics is great and they’ll spend time to help you with the understanding needed. It wasn’t around when I enrolled (so I pursued a minor in computing instead), but I enjoyed my time in both those schools.

With regards to prep, I suggest you read ahead for those topics! First complex numbers though it’s not called upon so early, then logic, linear algebra, combinatorics, in that order. Learn some basic programming too, programming is 99% exposure and practice so that’ll help a ton in BOTH Math and CS, you’ll be surprised at how code-intensive Math is! Feel free to PM if you have any questions about how Math was like.

EDIT: I saw in your other comments about wanting to work in finance, depending on which areas of finance you’re referring to, I agree you MIGHT want to consider BCG (business/computing) instead if you’re really really keen on keeping computing. However if by finance you’re referring to quant specifically, then DEFINITELY you’d want mathematics and computer science, and to avoid substituting math except for physics lol, this is speaking from my experience going through the hiring processes."

afrorials,1,"Hi, I randomly stumbled upon your post. I’ve read the problem statement.

It seems that there isn’t much chemical engineering stuff here, since you only have to design the CO2 capture process and not separate the CO2 from other gases. Moreover, if you look at the large scale direct air capture (DAC) plants, they look like huge fans to draw air in, and chemical engineering students never learn how to design a fan haha.

Note: We do learn plant equipment design, such as pumps, compressors, heat exchangers, chemical reactors, etc. Even so, we never really build these equipments, we just learn the design steps and calculations.

If you’re still interested in the competition, I suggest that you create a team with other engineering students that have hands on experience designing and creating machines (e.g. mechanical engineering, electrical engineering). Their skills will be useful in designing and creating the modular DAC, considering that you would have to design the modular DAC, choosing the materials, assemble the electrical circuit, etc. As a chemical engineer, probably you can contribute by calculating the mass balance of your modular DAC, ensuring that it meets the specified flowrate and it emits minimum CO2.

NoruchNorush,42,"Hi, I am an NTU student from China. After undergoing some online research, I personally think it is acceptable and understandable for NTU to promote the festival as Lunar New Year rather than Chinese New Year. Here's what I discovered:

Despite their similarities, Chinese New Year and Lunar New Year are not the same. While both terms can be used interchangeably as synonyms in casual conversation, Chinese New Year goes beyond the well-known animal zodiac system and incorporates other cultural and religious elements from ancient Chinese culture.

While Lunar New Year is typically celebrated on the same day as the Chinese New Year, it may fall on a different day in some countries. Many cultures, for example, celebrate the first new moon after the winter solstice rather than the second. Furthermore, while many other Asian countries celebrate Lunar New Year, they do not endorse Chinese cultural elements and instead honor each nation's customs and history.

In Singapore, 75 percent of the population is Chinese, and the majority of them still celebrate the festival in the traditional Chinese manner (the Chinese culture, food, traditions, religion, etc.). Furthermore, the public holiday is referred to as 'Chinese New Year' rather than 'Lunar New Year' on the websites of Singapore's Ministry of Manpower (MOM) and Ministry of Education (MOE). As a result, the term ""Chinese New Year"" has become standardized in Singapore's government system, and there is nothing wrong with calling it that.

However, as one of Asia's and the world's top universities, NTU is home to international students from many countries, not just China, who celebrate the festival but may not adhere to Chinese customs. Therefore, I actually think that calling it Lunar New Year demonstrates NTU's thoughtfulness to some extent.

Finally, vandalism should be strongly condemned because it is not only wrong and illegal in the first place, but it also reinforces negative stereotypes of Chinese people, which I absolutely hate as a Chinese myself.

In conclusion, I believe NTU made the correct decision in naming it Lunar New Year. Although the term ""Lunar New Year"" may arouse uncomfortable feelings in many Chinese students from China, Chinese students should also understand why NTU is doing it this way, as SAO stated that it is for the sake of inclusivity from the very beginning. Happy Chinese New Year to all Chinese around the world, and Happy Lunar New Year to you all!"

what happened was some Chinese society communities are in charge of organizing many new year events, setting up their shows / posters / campaigns and videos etc . After setting up , they were informed by SAO that ""Chinese New year"" should not be used,  but rather ""Lunar New year"" for the sake of inclusively.  


As a result, they have to scrape everything and modify every poster/banner that has the phrase ""Chinese New Year inside"", and obviously students are not happy because they had to do everything all over again.

Title

NTU Has Given Away Chinese Spring Festival (literal translation) to Other Countries

For 2 years, ""Chinese New Year"" has become a kind of taboo in NTU (Nanyang Technological University, Singapore). NTU has explicitly stated in policy the restriction of appearance (of the phrase) ""CNY"" in school events. The NTU Spring Festival Night of 2022 had to be re-recorded (Note 1), because the NTU

Student Affairs Office (SAO) ordered that all ""Chinese New Year"" phrasing in English to be amended to ""Lunar New year"". Is this respectful to the Chinese students? Is this respectful to every Chinese that prepared for the event?

In 2023, requested for any events related to Chinese culture to be jointly organized with other community organizations of other countries, didn't allow the apperance of ""Chinese New Year"" otherwise the school wouldn't approve it, and also to attempt to decrease the visibility of Chinese students.

Page 2

After encountering the unfairness of being intentionally neglected, communicated with NTU, NTU even threatened the organizations of Chinese students, disobey and the event will be handed over to other nation's student group to organize (note 2). When that time comes, ""Chinese"" existence will be even lesser.

Our Spring Festival, our culture, our history, (it) hasn't been stolen and it's already been robbed and given away to others by NTU. By taking advantage of the finances of Chinese Students Organization's money and manpower to ""make wedding dress (for others without benefit for self)"" for other countries (Note 3), by bowing hands and giving away Chinese Spring Festival (Note 4), NTU is purely being generous at the expense of others.

Page 3

Why the oppression against Chinese students or China organizations, the official response is, ""not liking Chinese people united (among themselves)""/not in favor of Chinese Students mingling among themselves (Note 5). Hence, the way NTU does is to unite with other organizations to ostracise Chinese students, chasing out Chinese (nationals) from any main Chinese events, I express disappointment with this. Singapore started out as a Chinese society (Note 6), the legally-defined public holiday they used the phrase ""Chinese New year"", it's one thing if the usage of the phrases Lunar/Chinese is mixed, but how can NTU take it upon itself to resist using the word ""Chinese"" and only allow ""Lunar"", what are the intentions for this?

For a university to do such a thing, All I can feel is that, indeed, a young university doesn't have enough generousity/tolerance, and lacks depth. Not being taken advantage of enough, hence willingly sacrificing students' satisfaction rating on anything, hence doesn't care if the students are disappointed.

Here, I implore all NTU students on XiaoHongShu, do not be in conflict with the fellow Chinese brethrens, and turn your spear towards NTU and NTU SAO who perpertrated all these, we Chinese students come from a mighty nation, (and) our traditional culture will not take this humiliation!

Edited today 5:12pm Singapore

""Do you agree to petition in reporting such deeds by NTU?""

81% Yes 19% No

Note

1 - I cannot find the official name in English for this event. Hence I translate as ""Spring Festival Night of 2022"". I found on LinkedIn ""NTU PRC Students Union"" but there's no posting activity, and I'm not sure if this XHS OP is a part of NTU Chinese Society.

2 - From the ""In 2023"" paragraph until the point marked ""Note 2"", the sentences in Chinese were written rather hastily, possibly impatiently by the OP for understandable sentimental reasons, hence my translations also looked odd.

3 - 做嫁衣， literally ""making wedding dress"", or in full ""making wedding dress for other people who is marrying out"". It's a slang in Chinese meaning ""to work hard only for others to gain their benefits and none for self.""

4 - 拱手相讓 is to ""bow hands to give away"". A Chinese idiom.

5 - 不喜歡中國人抱團 - I provide both literal and what I understand about this phrase. Take it what you will.

So ya, this happened cos NTU was being too damn extra.

CNY is the official term used by the SG govt. Plus, both the Korean New Year and Vietnamese New Year are (mainly) based on the Chinese lunisolar calendar so there's nothing wrong with the term ""CNY"" even if you wanna be PC lol. It's like banning the term ""Christmas"" on campus (in favour of ""X'mas"") cos non-Christians celebrate it.

Edit: I say they’re based on the Chinese lunisolar calendar cos (1) Korea’s new year is literally based on the Chinese lunisolar calendar and (2) Vietnam’s new year (tet) is based on the Vietnamese calendar, which is mostly based on the Chinese lunisolar calendar. Both adopted the festival cos of Chinese influence. 

Btw, there are many other lunisolar calendars (like the Burmese calendar, which has its new year in April this year), so the first day of this particular lunisolar calendar is quite undeniably a “Chinese new year”. Not saying “LNY” is wrong, I’m saying “CNY” is certainly not wrong and should not be rejected."

In other words, for every society they try to infiltrate and subjugate, there are always a set of principle toolkit of narratives and propaganda which are fundamentals from the Soviet KGB playbook. Strawman fallacies and other logical fallacies, Whataboutisms, misdirection (race is one of them), sabotage, etc.

The fact you guys bring this to Singapore at all, a natively Asian country, and accuse NTU SAO of pandering, has ironically answered all my confusion each time I see Chinese in the West protesting against racism under some party banner ... This is nearly always absolutely nothing to do with racism.

No wonder some Mainlanders there who do not join this social protests overseas have been claiming they never faced discrimination, and there seem to be a clear line between people who protest under the Chinese flag or party/embassy identity.

I know who to look for among other Mainlanders as allies now apart from the anti-CCP YouTubers.

Let me reiterate why I go to the police for even things like this. I recall now - once you let those people gaining foothold in our society, the more you repel them, the more aggressive their counter-tactics. So ALWAYS DO THE FIRST STRIKE."

If everything remains the same as last sem, you basically be reading aloud Chinese news article in class (just a 1 or 2 paragraph at most) for every class. She will also share some interesting stuff about life in general.

As for assignments:

you will be required to be write (in advance) and present a radio news segment (in-class) with a partner- not too hard, just follow her given example and make some adjustments to your selected news article. Your enunciation just need to be like how they read news on 958FM

do a Mandarin-only  group presentation on a company or business personality - best if you can do it w/o script or notes (if you wish to get high marks)

Final test: type out a short piece on a given topic + edit a given news article to a news radio broadcast length (\~140 characters). all within a time limit. For the short piece writing, try to engage in the class discussions and learn to arrange your thoughts in a sequential and clear manner. It will help a lot. Also, learn to practice typing Chinese quickly on your computer.

she is pretty chill and very polite (she greets everyone by their name when they walk in) and you all should be able to negotiate with her what works best for you all to get a good grade. Just let her know what are your concerns or if you need to take leave in advance."

thelastsurvivor28,5,"Even with a 4.8 you probably won’t get it if you’re not a scholar. These popular schools only have <5 spots and all of them are probably allocated to scholars since they have higher priority. My gpa was >4.5 and I couldn’t get any of my top 3 choices in the US. 

My advice is to check which schools you can course match with and choose a country you like/want to explore and a school that’s not so popular. Since exchange is pass fail you’ll probably spent more time exploring than actually studying."

Practical-Maximum553,1,"Hey, could you help me as well? Thanks!"
RunTimeErr,16,"Go for NTU.

1. Travel time.
You mentioned that you have that 0.5 year Exemption. That leaves you with 3.5 years. With internship taking up 1 semester, you are left with just 3 years.
Assuming the fact that you would get the 2 year guaranteed stay, you would only need to bear through the travelling for 1 year which is 2 sems. 

To be exact, its only 6 months of travelling since summer break and mid term takes up 4 months, and exam period takes up 1 month each. To add on, CS Lectures are mostly recorded, and there are quite a number of lectures conducted online as well. You can even self plan your timetable, and I have friends who stay in the East coming to school only 3 times a week.

There is direct shuttle buses from Heartland to NTU directly as well.

2. Curriculum.
I see many people here suggesting you to go for SUTD for the fact that CS Curriculum Sucks and SUTD is far mors rigorous. I can't comment anything on that since idk anyth about SUTD. Im from NTU and i didn't study at SUTD. And honestly, idk how people can come up with such conclusion that one is better than the other.

If you are serious about CS, the curriculum honestly doesn't matter. Period. CS is really about going beyond what is taught in class. Relying purely on the curriculum is ok, but it isn't going to take you far. For this reason, both SUTD and CS Curriculum makes no difference to me. If SUTD curriculum is indeed far more rigorous and better for you, I would rather that you come over to NTU and be a top scorer here, isn't it ? There's a reason why foreign students often opt for either NTU/NUS only. Nonetheless, SUTD is still great, but all the while I have only understood it as a design sch, didnt know there was CS. Pardon my lack of knowledge here.

People usually wouldn't value the things or environment that they are in, even if it is a dream of others. Because they have already experienced it, been in the position. Thus to them, its ""Nothing"". So take the comments here with a pinch of salt. Its like how you would tell stressed out secondary students that O levels is nothing more than just a paper after you experienced it. Chances are, if you consult in this NTU forum, most of them will tell you not to come over to NTU. Go through the posts and see it for yourself."
UltraDeGaming,7,"Bro honestly if I’m you, I’ll just go SUTD. You’ll be learning CS there as well. It’s still a degree that you’ll be going for.. plus it will not be an issue to get a job in the future especially for the industry sector you’re pursuing on"
iLowLife_,3,"I am also a SCSE student living in the East, coming to school back and forth is certainly taking up alot of travel time if you are not staying in hall...

This is why I rent a locker to keep my things safe and secretly sleep in the school's lecture theater, not only does this save me the travel time, but also the rental money, now I can wake up to eat breakfast and still get to class on time."
_04120420,7,"I have friends studying CS in NTU and my partner is doing CS in SUTD. Take it from me, go SUTD.

I could be biased since I'm more updated with my partner than my friends, but I perceive SUTD's curriculum is tougher and more demanding. That said, their employment rate is higher than NTU grads for roughly the same average pay. They also get to pass/fail their mods after seeing their grades. Might not seem like a big deal till you come NTU and you see the amount of students complaining about this lol.

First year compulsory dorms might suck if you stay so close, but it's helpful when you're chionging group projects. SUTD is short for Stay Up Till Dawn after all :)"

ZxZx9,1,"One more thing to consider is also future employment. If you are interested in joining big MNCs, NTU reputation definitely matters. Unfortunately, some to many MNCs silly recruitment procedures don't even consider past NUS, NTU and maybe SMU.

imntusenior,0,"Different students have preference for different things.

The only advice I can give is to get a 2nd upper and above, an engineering degree with a good honours + internship at a good company can also compete for non-relevant jobs if halfway through you change your mind about your career goals.

UnintelligibleThing,13,"Nanyang Scholarship is basically free money without additional commitment required. It's more like a prestigious bursary rather than a scholarship.

NTU-USP is a programme like its name implies. You have additional modules to take to ""expand your horizons"" and you have extra curricular activities (e.g. going overseas), all of which are compulsory as part of the scholarship conditions. You'll be hanging out with your fellow high-caliber NTU-USP scholars often, so your uni life compared to the typical non-scholar will be different.

NTU-USP is obviously the more prestigious one. It's one of the premier scholarship programmes along with CN Yang and Renaissance Engineering."
thelastsurvivor28,3,"Nanyang scholarship is just free money. No commitment or bond (for citizens) just keep your gpa 3.5/5 and above. NTU gives you the scholarship easily if you apply for it, have a high RP (>87.5) and do decently well at the interview. My interview three years ago was a pretty informal conversation. They just wanted to know about me and why I applied for NTU/my major.

Anti-DenseMan,22,"I'm going to sort of give a small but sad update on this

Not part of the ICC petition, but I was sort of (accidentally) in a feedback group for one of the ICC.

I have raised the subreddit's concern with the ICC's grading system with some of the adminstrative staff (Not directors), but the reply I got was that ICC actually helps pull grades up according to the findings.

So yep, this grading system will remain unless findings change.

I myself raised the issue with content being far too much for classes and I hope they fix this issue next year (This new semester might be too short to make changes).

The staff have noted the workload is too much, aware that for that one ICC there was insufficient time to cover all the weeks content in class, and will discuss within themselves on how to better distribute workload.

This is where the problem comes in, despite the emails given to multiple volunteers, I arrived with students only a quarter of the original numbers, and with few of us backing our concerns, it's hard to push for a point.

Overall, my feelings for this was that the ICC will hopefully change in terms of contents. Reduced workload would be appreciated. However, grading system will remain unless some of us seek for a feedback session for our ICCs.

TL;DR Grading system seems to benefit and therefore will remain, content was noted by staff to be too much and will be probably reduced. If we really want a change we really need the numbers to prove a point."

Anytime fitness is a scam (tiny gym and something crazy like 100 dollars a month), while Dennis gym is more than half that and is open 24/7. ActiveSG also doesn’t allow memberships for non-Singaporeans so you would have to pay about 5 dollars every time you gym (entry + bus fee) and had similar facilities to North Hill gym with like one deadlift bar. Plus it really just feels like a hotel gym so I wouldn’t be certain that you could deadlift heavy."
piggythekid,1,"May I know which country you're from? If there are Anytime Fitness chains located in your region, then it might be much cheaper to just get a membership from your home country instead. You will be given a key fob which can access any Anytime Fitness outlet in the world, which can be used in singapore as well.

That said, there are 4 anytime fitness outlets located within a 30min travel radius from NTU( Jurong point, Nanyang CC, Pioneer Mall and D'arena). The nearest one would be at Nanyang community center, with 2-3 eleiko stiff bars and an OPB. However, they have a pretty scuffed platform, and for that reason i prefer pulling at the D'arena outlet instead. 
You'll find the most powerlifters at the D'arena and Nanyang CC outlets so the lifting atmosphere will be a lot better. 

There are also a few decent powerlifting gyms in singapore such as Elevate barbell club and strengthyard. They have everything from combo racks to DL bars and calibrated plates. 
The only drawback is that they are located in the mid to eastern side of singapore and the commute will take over an hour. Also, u will find very elite level lifters (world record holders) training in these gyms, so it's defitinely worth visiting despite the travel time."

In my case my prof totally didn’t know what was going on and honestly I don’t think he really cared about EID, he just gave the whole group a A- cause at least our prototype worked. I think my biggest challenge in this project was getting the prof to talk to us and actually acknowledge that we exist LOL. 

Luckily I had a good group with no snake, no freeloader (rarity in this day and age) and all cheerful and easy to work with people. So it didn’t take up a ton of time. Just maybe every week work on the idea and prototype for a bit. 

Overall I think it’s quite ok la, just don’t treat it too seriously and stress too hard about getting A. If you can be easy going about it, you’ll be able to take the setbacks with prof/group/prototype not working in your stride and everyone will be happier overall, which is imo the key to getting A for group project."

I want to preface by saying that competitiveness is subjective and driven purely by your attitude towards learning. Personally, in the usp modules that I have taken, I observed (with a pleasant surprise) that most students are very open to exchanging ideas and helping one another. For instance, we have an academic writing module that mandates us to swap our essay drafts for peer reviews. Beyond the classroom, my group arranged meetings to thoroughly scrutinize and pinpoint areas of improvements for our essays. In hindsight, my essays remarkably improved from initial drafts due to the feedback I received from my peers. I generally do not get the competitive vibes in usp, but of course, in every batch, there will be some students who are very competitive - that's just life, right?

I entered usp thinking it would be a competitive environment, but my experiences thus far were contrary to those expectations. Feel free to dm me if you have more questions about usp!"

VelvetGlider,26,"1. No. If you looked up the academic workload you would see that there are less AUs to be cleared over 3 years than there are for the traditional 4 year courses.

2. Don’t know where or who you got this info from lmao. You’re entering Business, not Economics. There is literally one econs mod in Y1 and its remarkably easy.

3. You have to choose a specialisation after Y1 and before Y2 begins. There are grade requirements for certain modules to be able to enter certain specialisations, but of course it’s also merit-based. Even if you hit the grade requirements, there’s no guarantee of the spot in the specialisation if too many people want it and they have a higher GPA than you.

4. My guy literally said ‘NTU Business’ and asked for internship and career opportunities lmao. Did you expect a comprehensive list of every single business-related job role?"
studythatclef,4,"
1. no + workload has been manageable so far
2. no, answering method is a lot easier for biz econs, and with the way it’s structured, it might be easier to relearn everything from scratch, though having a background in econs would be a plus. mostly a lot of critical + fast thinking and consistency. 
3. yes, a specialisation is compulsory in y2 and is merit based. plus there’s also pre-requisites (e.g. B+ and above for python to specialise in analytics). you can take a minor on top of it. 
4. depends on your past experience, passions and how stacked your portfolio is. we have to do a compulsory graded professional attachment (PA) in y1 that you have to source yourself. then the rest of the years you’re on your own, whether you want to do internships is your problem and is usually based on your specialisation (e.g. BA specialisation —> data analytics intern, marketing specialisation —> marketing intern, but don’t restrict yourself to these roles as well, think abt what you’re passionate about). we have a careers service office just for business so you can go talk to them as well! & keep an eye out for emails that have good oppts. generally, nbs is well recognised among companies, but ofc we’re still in competition w the other unis. 
(edit: forgot the work-study degree u can do as well!)
5. you’ll do fine as long as you’re consistent."

3. You use your BDE to clear your minors. Spec is something you choose after Y1. You can take a minor if you like, this is optional"
Infinite_Tank_6659,3,"hi there! final year business student here :)

1. workload is manageable for sure, y1 might be tough to adapt to but definitely manageable. you can also choose to “underload” to manage your school life too, if you find yourself struggling. would not recommend this tho

2. not at all, i took H2 econs and got A for Alevels, and the only benefit it got me was an exemption from the econs mod in NTU. For the other mods, there was no or close to none econs concepts.

3. for specialisations, popular ones are banking & finance, marketing and HR. there are others but won’t go too in-depth. for B&F, you need to get a minimum grade of B+ for a Y1 mod Financial Management. To answer your question, yes you can input your choice but would definitely see the results you get as well 

4. this depends on what you want and also what you’re specialising in, to a certain extent. if you specialize in B&F (like me), there are a slew of job options such as investment banking, private banking, corporate banking etc etc.

if you need any more help or further clarification, feel free to reach out!"

Faith-Creuset,3,"Based on experience (happened once during Y1S2 course registration) SCSE CS

Background story: SCSE students were given the option to pre register for all their modules (which u should do in the event that u didn't manage to register for a course during star wars)

&#x200B;

On the day of Stars,ABP students were given an earlier star wars slot (which is the case most of the time) BUT minimum slots were released for indexes causing u to be unable to change the index you were allocated. However they released all the slots for all indexes for the non ABP students ,  meaning that the non ABP students can change their indexes freely given that all the slots for indexes were released, while the ABP students just watch in sadness :( . As an ABP student this prompted me to almost drop ABP had the star wars timing for ABP and non ABP students were different again

&#x200B;

A con that I can think of is 

1) May not be able to change index IF an option to preregister was given prior since slots for indexes have to be saved for those who did not preregister"

BEaSTGiN,45,"How important is getting a FCH to you?

Theoretically speaking, since you're only Y1S1, a 4.5 is always still possible. You'd now need an average of 4.78 every other sem, however. But seriously speaking, not only is that pretty damn hard to attain, it's also inevitably going to be a huge mental and physical strain on you. I'm not going to assume what your full potential is, and perhaps you just made the transition into Y1 badly, but honestly it doesn't seem worth it to burn yourself out just for that FCH.

If you insist on it, or otherwise, then what I can offer: are you studying correctly? I don't stress myself out on what I cannot do after 2 hours of staring at the screen, reason being if I don't get it after that there's no way I'm getting it in the exam. Stress is unproductive, 6 hours of stressed out studying is useless. I just make sure I know all the fundamentals of the course and do the PYP to see what the recurring questions (and tricks) are. Game the system. It's better to be able to do 70% of the paper with 100% accuracy in the exam, than to spend half the paper attempting what you can't do, then not even have time to check if you scored 100% of what you are supposed to be able to do. This is usually enough to secure a B+ for me (which is my baseline), and A- or A if I'm lucky. If you're feeling confident, by all means aim for A on your best courses.

Also if you haven't heard of it, if you know you are going to bomb a mod, DABAO. (i.e. take an certified MC on the final, which will allow you to retake the mod without affecting your grade). Otherwise if you pass but with a bad grade you will not be allowed to retake."
eccentric_eggplant,22,"TL;DR Given a concept, keep asking questions that push it and your learning to the limit. Do as much thinking for the exam as you can before the exam itself.
___

Some preamble on uni vs lower-level tertiary education: Uni is a different ballgame compared to JC and poly. I came from poly so I can't speak for JC, but I assume it's the same: Hard work and brute force is enough to get you good results. In other words, someone studying a lot is likely to get somewhere close to someone studying a lot and studying smart. 

In uni, my personal experience is that is no longer the case. It's not a night and day difference, but it's significant enough that results can definitely drop if study techniques are not tweaked. Studying smart in the context of uni isn't necessarily about study hacks (although those will help too, I'm sure), but more critically thinking about the concepts. For example, given statement A:

* What if we vary parts of the statement? Is it still true?

* Is it plausible that the exams will vary parts of the statement? If yes, how?

Asking all kinds of questions about a given concept probably helps you internalize and understand it better, but the key benefit I've found is that it covers blind spots that your learning materials will have. For simplicity, statement A may be true, but it may also be varied to create statements B, C, D. I've encountered numerous times where the learning materials in totality (lecture and seminar slides, tutorial questions, project questions) cover statements A, B, C and stop there, and then the exams test on statement D.

Of course a case can be made that if you are really smart to begin with, that you will still be able to apply what you have learned into a very different situation. And if you are really hardworking and can pour 12 hours into studying the textbook, you theoretically would be able to cover at least 95% of the scenarios that appear. If that's the case, great! I am not a smart person, nor do I have the interest or time to read textbooks cover to cover, so I have found this to be a great compromise that helps me get close to (but admittedly not compete with) the beasts.

A broader point here is that you want to do as much of the thinking related to the exam before the exam itself. How I actually do this is to create my own flowcharts after many, many hours of studying and dissecting the learning materials that guide me on my thinking in the exam itself. Not all modules require this, but for modules that require a lot of mental gymnastics, I have found this to be a lifesaver. A great bonus is that by the end of the programme, I have a collection of materials that I can come back and refer to if I ever need them for my work."
ClassicSink5547,17,"For every lesson, ensure that you understand the basics of that lecture before going back home to do tutorials. For me in CBE, usually in the lecture notes provided, the first few slides would contain pointers of the learning objectives. I would always follow closely to the learning objectives based on the content taught, and ask questions while referring back to the learning objectives.

Usually the questions I asked are quite stupid to others in the class but I just suck thumb cause I know I don't have the brains like them. And asking questions helps to form your thought process.

If there are no learning objectives, or the learning objectives written in the notes by the prof are not well-tuned to the content taught, then it would be wise to write your own additional learning objectives and clarify with the profs after the lesson ends. (This would help to ensure that you are on the right track when concluding the content with your own short pointers while ensuring the class will end on time and not get complained by your peers for asking too many questions during the lesson.)

I've also tried to study through digital notes on notability / goodnotes and printed coloured notes. But I do find myself more comfortable in studying and listening to class on printed notes since it just feels solid on my hand and I was able to remember most of the stuffs taught in class. You can find your own type by trying out both, since you are still in year 1.

I've also find myself studying alot through recorded lectures instead of attending the physical one. This is because I was part of the undergrad that started uni during 2020, the start of covid pandemic. Hence, I develop this sort of habit that I would remember the content of the lecture taught based on time stamp of the video. Like for example, if the concept of that topic is asked in the tutorial, I would just refer it based on the time stamp of the recorded lecture video. (You can try and see if you are well suited for recorded lectures / attending the actual one next sem.)

I also had the luxury to attend the same tutorials (since the prof didn't mark attendance and is ok with it) for some of the teaching weeks in order to reclarify my queries with the prof, or just sort of get the flow of how the tutorial works before redoing my tutorials. It's painstakingly tedious but it gets the job done since some of the modules didn't record the tutorials.

You can also try to look at the textbook used for the particular module. For me I always go to libgen / pdfdrive to source out the pirated e-books. Some of the slides used by my profs were apparently rephrased to the point that it would be easier to understand using the textbook instead of looking at their slides.

Lastly, I would also like to inform you that mindset and resting are very important as you progress towards Y2 and Y3, as you will be taking specialization modules that will get harder.

Sleep is important as that is what keeps you energized and set your mood for the day before your first lecture of the week / quiz / exams. During my Y2 and Y3, I've switched my sleeping time from as early as 7pm to 3am to as late as 4am to 11am due to backlog of lab reports and projects, but I always ensure that I have at least 7 hours of sleep.

Mindset is important as that is what will determine your mental health throughout the 16 weeks of semester. I've screwed up multiple CA's (quizzes) throughout Y1 to Y3. Getting fails and passing grades for some of them, and thankfully securing 70 to 75% for the better ones.

Usually the profs would release the quiz results right after 2 - 4 weeks of marking. However, if the question paper is not kept by the profs, I would just ask the prof during that week of the quiz for guidance on how to solve it. Most of the profs would be kind enough to teach you the process to solve some questions, and I would just redo my quiz again and wait for the actual answers to come out again and compare it.

For those quizzes that I've just passed / failed, I always told myself that it is not over yet. Since by the time when exam period is coming, there will be alot of students frustrated with the endless projects / 2nd quiz / take home assignments. During this period of time, keep your momentum going but keep it moderately paced, and don't get burned out.

PS for writing a long story, but I hope it helps.

\- 5 of my core modules that i got passing grade (50/100 for quiz) , I was able to get 4 A- in the end, and 1 of them A+.

\- 3 of my core modules that i got a failed grade (30 to 40/100 for quiz), I was able to get B, B+ and A for it."

- Hunt for the textbook pertaining to that module and do the problems inside. 

- Have a consistent sleep schedule.

imntusenior,22,"At CGPA 2.5, just score higher than C+ overall and your GPA will slowly climb from here.

Make use of different systems to skew the odds in your favour.

Tough mods? Convert into P/F during exchange semester (can be local exchange also).

Have nice GPA already and don't want further mods to drag it down? Clear some MOOCs to not let electives affect your CGPA."

b) your effort and time is spent inefficiently, or

c) you lack fundamental understanding in the mods/ need a change in perspective in how you approach the mods.

spideytaha,3,"Its just a number bro lmaooo, keep calm, have fun in school and do what makes you happy.

Network, make friends and explore your likes and dislikes. That's the whole point of uni; instead of chasing a number chase your dreams man"
Valkyre99,3,"It is possible to pull up your GPA to 4.5 but you need to work very hard. Count it as a blessing that you did poorly early on in your uni career because you can improve moving forward (if you score 2.5 in year 2 or 3 it is harder or impossible to climb up). 

But also think you should ask yourself why you did so badly. If you were lazy and can put in more effort, then just work harder. If you tried your best and still got a 2.5 GPA, either you're not very cut out for this course or your studying methods are v inefficient. 

If FCH is very important to you and you can afford it financially, consider taking less mods each sem and spreading out your mods by delaying graduation, or clearing mods with MOOCs and on exchange (free pass fail) to freeze your GPA and allow you to focus on doing well for fewer graded mods."

HappyRockRock,6,"I think taking a second major does not increase your employability directly unlike double major, and it doesn't actually increase your skills directly.

So basically, with the mods you take in ur second major, you learn some theories that would be useful if you can apply those knowledge into some internship, otherwise you just end up forgetting them. But whether they accept you for internships is quite dependent on your gpa (+ maybe your relevant experiences).

In HASS, to more likely get hired, a second upper is almost a minimum as well as having a diversity of experiences gained from work/intern (and to an extent, CCAs). If you need to put in more time for your second major and your gpa and portfolio suffer because of the second major, it's kind of a losing situation?"
rindeeer,2,"2nd major in comms, HASS student here. The bell curve is steep in wkwsci, I scored B+ for a module when I was doing above average for every test. So yea your CGPA might drop. I'm graduating (i took the 3.5 years route) with a 2nd upper.

Employability wise a 2nd major definitely helps. My current employer hired me on the basis that I have a 2nd major in comms and my main major is totally ignored lol. But thats also because I applied for a comms role. 

Then again theres the interview factor where it depends on how you spin your narrative. My friend who did a minor in comms secured internships easily because of the way she presented herself.

I have friends who did 2nd major in comms and their cgpa fell. But they still got their internships because they applied based on what they are good at/have experience in (film) and they had a strong portfolio to show (from their poly days etc).

So I would say yes 2nd major is good to have, but make sure you have a good story to tell during interviews + strong portfolio if you are looking at employability. Also got to make sure what you apply is in line with what you really like to/want to do.

CGPA wise, I prefer to maintain a 2nd upper in case I want to go for gvmt jobs. But as my friends have shown, even if you drop, back it up with your interest/passion and show the hirer your portfolio as evidence."
Hellowhatup789,1,"If you are really keen on the major then i would suggest you take up the invitation for 2nd major first. If you realise it is not suitable you can always drop it, rather than not taking it up and then having to go through the trouble of registering for it.

Personally I also opted for wkw 2nd major initially (ngl partially because i see many of my frens taking so i fomo hahaha) but while i find some of the mods interesting, i also felt that many weren't exactly to my liking. Sadly I also did q avg for all of these mods so my gpa dropped q a bit lol so in the end im going to drop it to a minor and instead spend the remaining AUs to take other mods i might be more interested in. Tbh grading can be q competitive for wkw mods (ppl are more outspoken for class part, generally proficient in writing, eloquent when presenting, some have media background etc.) but with that said I have frens taking wkw 2nd major who also did well for these mods so its not impossible to score.
