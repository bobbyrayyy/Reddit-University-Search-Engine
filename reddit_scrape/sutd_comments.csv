- Is a degree necessary, or at least preferable when it comes to getting jobs as a pilot or an air traffic controller? Does it matter what you study?
- Seems like a massive commitment (of both money and time) to even become qualified. If you aren't hired at Singapore's airports, are you just screwed? Will you be forced to work overseas if you can't find a job here? Is there a lot of competition for your job?

9Brkr,1,"If you really, really, really know what you want to do, then perhaps you might see it as disadvantageous. The curriculum is structured in a way to expose you to interdisciplinary problems and get you to think how different disciplines are interconnected. This gives you an appreciation for real world problems through the projects that require you to use knowledge from different mods. Both systems engineering and computer science will require both math and programming. Both mechanical engineering and architecture will require some appreciation of math and physics. 


I'd also counter by asking, do you really want to do CS? I know several people who started off Y1 with a firm idea of what they planned to study, but chose a different specialization in Y2. Their decisions were influenced by the experiences they had in Y1 going through the different mods they were required to take, which was the whole point - to expose you to different disciplines and gain an appreciation for each of them. You're not required to choose your pillar/major until the end of Y1 so it gives you time to think and ponder what you enjoyed, time to ask seniors questions about the experiences in each pillar, allowing you to make an informed decision before choosing. To my knowledge, no other university in Singapore allows you to do this (yet?) without having to restart from Y1 again. 


What you asked is a valid question, but I'd urge you to also see the other side of the coin and ask why doing the extra mods could be beneficial for you."
valleyofpeace,1,"I think the y1 mods act as a good foundation, you might need the math and physics knowledge depending on which cs track you choose. But yea if you already are experienced and want to dive into the in depth stuff straightaway then you will find the y1 mods unnecessary.

But y1 is the best time for you to explore stuff (like other majors or ccas) and also to make friends. And also to enjoy yourself cos it's the most chill year."

luzm,2,"Hi, 

It's a good question.

You don't get less tech exposure compared to other uni. 

It is inaccurate to compare by the number of modules.

SUTD CSD core has longer contact hours (wider topics coverage per module). 

Let's pick NTUC SC2001 Algorithms and  SUTD 50.004 Algorithms for example.

SC2001 total contact hours = 42 hours.

[https://www.ntu.edu.sg/docs/librariesprovider118/ug/cs/ay2018/year-2.pdf?sfvrsn=92da69be\_2](https://www.ntu.edu.sg/docs/librariesprovider118/ug/cs/ay2018/year-2.pdf?sfvrsn=92da69be_2)

50.004 contact hours 5 hours per week over 12 weeks = 60 hours. 

Almost each term in SUTD you have a 2D project, (cross module project).

You should look at the syllabus and topics, not just by counting the modules."
NashediPanda,2,"Hi, from what I remember, the interview was pretty chill. They ask you about stuff that you mentioned in your application, and the usual questions such as ""Why did you choose SUTD?"", ""What is your subject of interest and why?"" etc.

As for the math/physics questions, I don't they don't ask everyone. I wasn't asked any math/physics questions when I gave the interview last year.

Getting the admission status varies, I got mine a week after the interview, but for some, it came out a month later. There is no second round of interviews as far as I know.

Hope this helps, all the best!"

Alive_Cardiologist24,1,"Question 3: The breadth and depth is pretty intense, no need to worry about it. Most courses are based on a textbook, and they usually cover most of it topic wise. The projects are also directly related to the content you learn, so they go hand in hand. 

Question 4: yes there is one core mod to be taken in sophomore cs where you learn low level programming and hardware. You’ll be designing circuits and programming a beta cpu that goes with it. Apart from this there are other electives that you can take. 

Software engineering mods are pretty up to date as well and there’s one that teaches different sdlc like agile methodology, waterfall method etc."

Also, if you get selected for an interview, they may ask why your results are not favorable, so come up with a reasonable explanation. kinda obvious but don't lie in your interview too.

Q1)The main benefits of STEP includes:
1. One year overseas, UC Berkeley Extension Entrepreneurship International Diploma Programme which includes an exchange and silicon valley internship, tsinghua/zhejiang/xi'an jiaotong exchange.
2. Masters in Entrepreneurship (inclusive of any business related thesis)
3. Scholarship, its all free, with the overseas experience having about 28k sponsorship
Most people who I've seen that argued against STEP werent able to go overseas, and there's abit of a mismatch of expectations where many entrepreneurs dont want to sacrifice the additional year because they want to work on their startup earlier.

Q2)You can try emailing your Point of Contact, I remembered asking about it after attaining a Global Distinguished Scholarship a few months after applications and my point of contact just sent me the STEP questions and held a separate interview specifically for STEP.

huixiang01,8,"Hmm as an EPD grad ( but my track is mechE), sutd is more interdisciplinary. As a design engineer now, I would need skills that are quite interdisciplinary too. It is also essential to know what other people are doing so that you won't get lost in meetings. For example, me understanding the limits of what an EE or com scientist can and cannot do, and also contribute well into the meeting. Sometimes, you probably need to apply skills you are not specialized in. At times, I have to code Arduino/python to make a machine to test my mechanical system or tap power from an establish prototype (Why? cus I don't have lead time) The rationale here is to be adaptive and flexible to fast track the things you would learn out there in the workforce, while university provides the basic foundation you need so that you won't be stranded in nowhere land. Bear in mind universities will have significantly less spoonfeeding.

And like what typical sutd marketing would say, sutd provide a chance to switch your major (i.e. try for a year then you choose what you want to do) which quite a substantial people I know act switch.

And uh... Design here in sutd is not everything artsy stuff.  Our concept of design is more of solving problems, more of engineering problem. It is also another scope of looking at things, such as the old ""here is the problem, hence solve it"", but rather ""here is a problem, but actually is it a problem?"" And ofc, sutd does teach the technical engineering skills to solving it, but not as deep as NTU/nus, but we are broader in terms of interdisciplinarity. And uh... There are more aspects of design rather than just this... Which sutd in turn forces students to take humanities classes almost every term (around 1/4 of your curriculum would be humanities)

About whether you can get a job... I think it is very possible to get one, esp if you put in the effort. The fabrication lab is readily available to use or urop for you to do. If you wanna beef up your resume and do more project, I think sutd have the resource to do so...( Maybe go linkedin and bomb a random EE grad to ask, hence a piece of better advice and also bear in mind doing a project is only feasible if you have spare time after your studies and what not). If you want to find where sutd grad goes, linkedin can be a way to track them ;)

Generally, workload in sutd is sometimes unpredictable... Like due to bad teammates or project politics. But I personally think that it is a learning experience that everyone should experience before going to the workforce.

But uhh... As a grad after experiencing sutd, not everything is just work work, get a good GPA, and then get a job. Also, you prob need to decide what kind of experience really make you a better version of yourself after 4 years of study."

marshmallow-alpaca,1,">some of the lectures will clash with my ESD cohort classes.

As for CSD lectures, comp struct lectures tend to go through problems often. Info sys and algo iirc does go through questions from time to time. All lectures were pre recorded and we could access it anytime, not sure if it will change in the upcoming term.

>is it compulsory to take the mid-term exam of a CSD module?

Not sure, even if its allowed you will most likely need to take make-up exam. But as mentioned, OSA probably won't allow you to take conflicting modules (timetable clashes). You can try to email student admin to clarify this issue, and see if they are able to deconflict your combination."

9Brkr,2,"With CSD being immensely popular, its high intake means people of different coding backgrounds and experiences go in. As long as you work hard, diligently and consistently there shouldn't be an issue. Just note that there is a fair amount of self-learning involved and you cannot rely on school/course material to get you up to speed on how things work all the time - they're usually just there to give you a basic understanding but beyond that (i.e. practical applications) you'll need to look it up to enrich your learning. Temper your expectations when you go in and don't expect to be spoon fed information, but feel free to ask your profs and TAs questions (important!! Not just ask your friends)


Also please look up what is actually taught in these modules. A recurring piece of feedback is that students expect a course to teach them A, only to receive B. An example would be machine learning, which can mislead some people into thinking it is more on application, when in reality its really about the foundation, which is basically math."

Cai fan had newspaper in it
Cai fan had an insect with 6 legs, wings and a tail in it

Spagetee,3,everyone in sutd memes abt how trash the canteen is. but imo the only one i activly avoid is cai fan. jap korean isnt great but it is food. the rest are all ok. indian stall roti prata is top tier if it is fresh so like morning 8-10ish. price average is around 5-6 before drink. drink is cheap $1+. by requirement there are cheaper meals around 2.5-3 maybe cos of school requirements.

Elroytan,2,"I didn't do an internship so I can't talk about that but I did do urop.

There are official ways you can get into a urop(at the end of every term) but most likely you will miss it you can check the schedule at SUTD website.

If you missed it just check out the faculty research interests and when you find something you like just email them and explain what you want to do.

Most urops are rather chill what you get from it is if you put in the effort. But it is a case-by-case basis I heard some professors are really bad. So if you have an area in mind find a professor in that area and email them what project they have. Then figure out if they have the project you want and are the right professor for you.

You can ask around if the professor is any good. They should accept you even if you don't have any experience. SUTD is so small that when you find your interest you keep on seeing the same people where ever you go. (they don't mind grooming you if you have the interest)

But don't just suddenly ghost them because urops have little backlash when you leave. They have deadlines to meet doing that is irresponsible.

Alone_Abrocoma_9666,1,"hi! i hope this isn’t too late but it’s not like an academic programme. I was a SEED student for JC2 (now applying to SUTD) and there was no workload or schedule or things like that. Basically SEED allows you to engage with SUTD through more events and activities that are open to you! If you’re interested in research, you can sign up for a research project under a mentor. All events and activities are based on your own free time (i only attendees those during holidays!)

In general, SEED is just a way to gain a better understanding of SUTD and gauge your suitability. You will also have a designated poc which is super helpful when you have any questions. One benefit is the fact that you will directly be able to continue your application through SEASA (early admissions portal) without having to redo an application. The conditional admission offer in your JC2 might also motivate you to work just a little bit harder to meet the prelim criteria!"

Spagetee,2,yes but you can only join a pre-existing urop. the week 11 one is to apply for a new urop. Check your email or ask your profs if they know anyone who is looking for people. If you find a project you want just email the prof incharge asking about it.
Elroytan,1,"Just replying back to the message I posted it turns out UROP has cycles? So if you miss the cycle I assume  it is ""week 11"" then you can't join the UROP but wait till the next cycle. If someone has a different experience to prove me wrong please correct me."
9Brkr,4,"Help us understand your situation - are you applying to SUTD's undergraduate programme or post-graduate programme?

&#x200B;

Based on what you have indicated, you are a diploma holder, meaning you will likely be applying to the undergraduate programme. For undergraduates, your first 2/3 trimesters are foundation terms. Most undergraduates are fresh out of poly/JC/NS, and while age gap may be a concern for you, fret not as regardless of which pillar you intend to choose (ASD/CSD/EPD/ESD/DAI), everyone is required to go through the same foundation. Only after your first 3 terms do you go into your selected pillar (in your case, ASD)

&#x200B;

For post-graduate programmes (i.e Masters or PhD), this is where most people apply after working (and graduating with a bachelors). People have varied working experiences, from 0 (i.e. continue studying immediately after finishing bachelors) to several years in the industry. Generally they feel a bit out of place as it takes some getting used to the rigour of academia again, but they let their working experience guide them in their studies, such as professional work ethic, connections to suppliers/vendors, team/project management etc.

&#x200B;

For undergraduates, you will have to work in teams with fellow students for projects, so contributing your experience will definitely be appreciated. For post-graduate studies, you will likely be working solo for your thesis/research, but knowing how to manage your time goes a long way. Regardless of which route you are in, don't feel pressured to already know what to do, and don't be afraid to ask questions."

Based on the interviews i got i feel that GPA isnt as important as actually having more experiences and projects in your resume, and explaining them well during the interview.

Some interviews also ask knowledge-specific questions (I kena-ed networks, algos (BFS) and Java related questions) so doing well for those also certainly help as well"

When I spoke to my academic advisor she recommended not to do this though, since the workload for SUTD is already pretty tough. I think it also depends on which track you're in since certain mods may be required and they are only held during certain terms.

If you matriculated early, you would have the option to clear some mods before officially entering the school (only first year mods/HASS) so you could clear those credits beforehand. From what I heard from my friends graduating in 2025 they didn't have this option under early matriculation anymore though, probably need to check this.

Generally though, I doubt it is possible to graduate SUTD earlier than everyone else would."

for research you can approach any profs/lecturers and ask for a urop (usually anyone can join and is unpaid) or a paid urop (under student helper scheme).

i did the paid urop before and you just need to fill in a timesheet (prior to 2021) and get your prof to sign (no. of hours were arbitrary, my prof was okay with anything between 0-64hrs per month 👍 i.e. $0 - $640. i usually just request for 300-400). anyway the submission of timesheet should be online nowadays and the signature was replaced by an email to authorize and validate your hours worked (last checked 2021)

&#x200B;

its really a fun and engaging way to step into the realm of research! you get to apply what you learnt in classes and contribute to a research project (commonly you would actually contribute to a phd student's research xd i know cuz i later became friends with the phd student i helped do research (data scraping and cleaning) for)"
Snuffle247,8,"**Waste basket** to hold rubbish so gathering and throwing trash is easier.

**Plates and bowls** to prepare breakfast in.

**Cooking utensils** like pans, chopping boards and knives are not provided. I know of some students who cook in bulk for the week, others who cook dinner regularly.

**Fridge**. You'll be limited in your food options without easy access to refrigeration. You can be creative and find ways around it. Eggs and bread can keep for at least a week outside the fridge. Peanut butter doesn't spoil. Luncheon meat is immortal while canned and tasty when fried. 

Most **fruits last for a long time outside the fridge**. Try visiting the fruit stalls at Simei MRT station and buy fruits from them. It's cheaper than NTUC.

Certain fruits like bananas ripen faster when bagged, and thus turn bad faster. Buy green, unripe bananas, and let them slowly ripen over time. Apples, oranges, pears, all last for a long time outside a fridge. Kiwis and mangos too, but I wouldn't trust grapes.

When buying groceries, go to the **NTUC at Eastpoint mall** (next to Simei MRT) instead of the one at Changi City Point. Eastpoint NTUC has the cheaper range of goods and will help to stretch your dollar. The bakery at the MRT station sells good buns, including Japanese biscuits, and the chicken rice stall there is amazing. Look for a eatery called ""Snackshop"" and try their soya sauce chicken rice. Highly affordable as well, at only $3 a plate.

Once you start enrolling for courses by yourself (T3), depending on whether there are multiple classes for said course, you can try to pick the class with a later schedule if it is available (first come first serve).

UrFriendKen,4,"Hi there, current HG housing senator here. To my knowledge, there is no priority given in such circumstances. Wait list is usually ordered based on the tiebreaker CR3, travel time from local address for students with a local address.

Also, not sure what has been communicated to you regarding status if you are on the wait list for term stay only as opposed to vacation + term stay due to the indication of stay period during housing application back in Feb. I could look into it to find out how it generally works, but best course of action for you is to email Housing directly to find out.

As for not meeting CR2 due to personal wellbeing/medical/other circumstances, it is handled on a case by case basis during appeals.

is_a_act,1,"\> does staying in hall (past the compulsory 2 terms) make a big difference? esp for asd students, cause i’m planning to declare that as my major; i heard you have to complete many projects overnight, and staying in hall saves a significant amount of time from travelling. i stay on the other side of the east-west line, so…..I think you've answered your own question; >3h of commute daily is going to suck if you don't stay in hall. it's a big difference in social life too, since it's at least double the time spent with your friends if you stay in hostel.> how is dorm life like??? esp since it’s all double rooms. any disruptive/inconsiderate roommates? like, on a scale of Perfect to You Need To Buy Noise Cancelling Headphones And Sleep Shades? hahahamy freshmore roommate liked partying a lot and i didn't, but it never really affected us because we just talked about it and i'm a p tolerant person. we'd have friends over and i was mutual friends with most of his friends, so that was all cool i think. that said i did use earphones and an eye mask at some points. that's just life in hostel imo though, nothing personal> i think the showers are communal, so…. how clean are they, really. i know i will bring shower shoes and a shower caddy already, but like. do i need to bring a hair dryer too?eh. i've heard stories about some idiot taking a dump in the shower tray so. assume they're filthy. i usually showered with my slippers on.> do the air-conditioners work well!!!! i am a walking heater so if the fans&aircons aren’t capable of arctic level temperatures pls let me know so i can bring my own fan or something!!!! thank you sm!!!!!!yeah, actually. my roommate and i just split the cost and used it pretty liberally. like every night. but we're both from the same background - i think it's different for roomies where money is a concern.> how’s student culture like? are people friendly? is it a generally party culture, or cram culture, or 25/8 grind culture… i am undisciplined and Working On It so please tell me if i need to do some mental prep 😬 (also: do people generally dress well there? need to know what clothes to pack lol)very friendly. but just embrace the cringe that some people are going to exhibit. not to say you should be cringe, but some people play the social media game and you'll see their linkedin filled with buzzwords. i personally disapprove, but hey, it's their life. i think you will see a lot of party culture because the partying people want to be seen, but i've had plenty of friend groups who are very varied, some rush things last minute, some are the quiet studious type, some are a mix and will absolutely study like crazy and get hammered once in a while. it varies a lot. i think CGP Grey's video on themes is a good place you should look at to think about who you want to be and how to stick to that.> i got offered conditional acceptance so i have to attend the ILP thing… it’s pretty much jc stuff right, so. what’s it like? also is there some test or something at the end and do i have to do Amazing at it?i don't think so, it's just helping people get up to speed so they don't get absolutely wrecked by freshmore. it helped me revise after army but before uni."

UrFriendKen,0,6. No clue. Am from poly eng. lel
UrFriendKen,3,"1.Very true, there are too many group projects. The difficulty mostly comes from having to coordinate your time between the usual 3 concurrent projects and 1 HASS project/essay in the second half of the term. The content itself is pretty manageable.

In your first year when everyone in the class is taking the same courses, it's relatively easier to find a common time compared to T4 and onwards. You just have to plan ahead and schedule time, or have teammates do components of the project in their own time and meet for integration. It depends on the specific group and project type.


2.Academically, you are required to do so only for 2D (2-dimensional) projects. Ie, 2 predefined course content have to be included. For example, chemistry and programming courses, or social science and design courses.

In your later terms, you will be picking the HASS course that you want. There are HASS courses like digital humanities which focus on data/computational/technological analysis or application for humanities. The link for these course are pretty obvious. For history courses, understanding the changes that have taken place and how it has affected designs, and learning from mistakes. For social sciences, understanding your target audience/how designs affect behaviour/interactions. For literature/world text, design using a concept to achieve a certain outcome based on your understanding as interpreted from the text (the one that's the most out there). There are also skill based HASS like surveys and management. So it isn't just limited to history, literature or social sciences."
is_a_act,2,"The general way I thought about terms was like this:

Weeks 1-4 of every term are the weeks spend getting people up to the same level so they're easier generally. there's time for personal projects or studying in advance during these weeks.

Weeks 5-7 are for midterms.

Weeks 7-10 are a breather and to catch up on stuff you don't understand well and clear projects.

Weeks 10-14 are crunch time, revision for exams and finishing up projects.

As for how to manage workload - i'm a big believer in getting work done as soon as you can so it can't pile up. It's a lot of work, no doubt, but you have a lot of time (it may not feel like it, but as a working adult, i can tell you that you have a lot of time.) 

(i mean admittedly joining ESD was one of the biggest things to help me manage my workload, but that's not a option for most...)

re: linkage between HASS and design - the HASS modules are there to make sure you don't graduate as a dumbass who clones dinosaurs because science. whatever you make is going to be made for a world with people and, depressingly, against the backdrop of capitalism. some amount of hass is there to help you understand the bullshit of corporate culture, or to have tools to think about the world. many hass profs are fairly depressed at the state of the world (and rightly so). i guess to answer your question - there isn't one, not directly, but it's to help you understand and think about the world which the technology/design is applied to."

futboi99,9,I'll answer 6 specifically. I also got offers elsewhere but i choose SUTD. SUTD has alot of opportunities to do group projects and collaborate (almost every mod has 2-3  projects min be it large or small) which i personally liked as compared to the traditional university. You also pick up alot of skills you never thought you would know.
zippyelectron,5,"question one: there’s our tampines hub, tampines mall, tampines 1 and changi city point near sutd & there’s a wide variety of food options there to choose from

question six: i got offers frm nus, ntu & sutd but i chose sutd instead bc they have a course which i’m more passionate abt & sutd is a 7 min drive away from home :-)

i couldn’t answer questions 2-5 bc i’m an incoming student, so sorry!"
huixiang01,3,"1. Yes. That's why I brought my bike to school. :) bedok 85/ Simei have good cheap food.
2. First year. yes you have to pay for hostel, but that does not mean you have to stay. but projects would probably make you stay.
3. There are hostel activities if you want to stay in the hostel after the first year... but people would go for the fifth row more often(CCA in your terms)
4. Like: Profs, and projects, Dislike: Profs and projects. love-hate relationship
5. NA
6. nope. no regrets. After I decided, I abided by it after considering it for some time. That is how i move forward."
is_a_act,3,"ESD Alumni here.

>Do you ever get bored of the school food? Are there better and more food options near SUTD? (From the website it seems like there isn't much f&b services in SUTD considering that it has a small campus)

A little. It's hard to cook in hostel because of the general heat and the distance to the kitchen, but the kitchen's fun for when you want a class hotpot party or something. I'm not fussy with food, though - I ate the same thing like 3-4/5 days a week, with the other days being spent eating outside with friends. (i was also severely restricting my budget and eating cheap stuff...) I don't have much advice here besides saying that if you're a picky eater, CCP and CBP is going to be a lifesaver for you probably. though it might be expensive compared to canteen food.

>How is your experience living in the halls? Since it is compulsory to stay in the campus for the first two terms, did you face any issues during your stay/ do you have anything you liked about it (specific to SUTD)?

I really liked hostel. It's easy to spend time with friends, pop over for games, last minute projects, discussions, midday naps, all that. Though... some of the think tanks aren't locked and i know people who sleep in them away from the view of security...

>Is there any hall activities and if there is, how was your experience with it?

I think hall activities are bullshit. If hall culture is mass-organised activities we are doomed to generic icebreaker games and free food. Hall's a way to make meeting friends easier. stop trying to get me to talk to people I don't want to talk to.

>What is a few things you like/dislike about SUTD?

The fab lab is a HUGE plus. talking to friends from NUS, their ""fab lab"" consists of a collection of power tools handed down from generation to generation and 1-2 laser cutters no one known how to adjust the focus of. Being able to make your own things and knowing where to get hardware and materials? loved that. Stuff I disliked would be the puritan rules around alcohol; what am i, a child? (yes, i know there is some valid reasoning around it but at least treat us as adults pls)

>For those that had to go for additional summer classes, how was it and what did you need to do? (Since my rp was low, I was offered a conditional offer which meant that i need to attend to additional summer class)

Can't help you there, sorry. If you're talking about ILP, I studied the noted remotely after NS-related brain-rot and it was a little helpful.

>If you got offers from SMU,NTU AND NUS but still decided to enter SUTD, did you regret it and why?

Can't help you on this front. I was applying to yale-nus and they rejected me (maybe a blessing in hindsight) as well as NUS USP (also a blessing considering their fate now) but yale-nus rejected me and SUTD gave me a good scholarship before I could apply to USP. I got too much anxiety writing my essay at that point that I stopped and just went to SUTD. but in hindsight, neither place would have been as good at preparing me for industry as where I am now. yale-nus was very ivory-tower academia, i think, and USP... well USP might've been good, but it definitely didn't have a fab lab and the kind of social support that SUTD does when it comes to some of my interests."
seaehllugh,1,"hey! i’m in the same boat as you, so this thread was really helpful. as for 5, i believe it’s pretty similar to what we (i assume you’re from jc, but if you aren’t, then i) learnt in jc content wise? except for the computing ilp, but i’m not even sure if every student has to take all the classes haha."
canceler80,11,"Class of 2015. Best time of my life. Met the love of my life there in 2012 too.

ZealousidealTrust160,6,Nope. Still my fav sch. 6 yrs here and counting 😀
Spagetee,3,"class of 2025, only con i can think of is hostel rules, some of which are very dumb. Covid era hostel rules was a circus, but people still found ways to party. other than that id say alot of the issues you may or may not face in sutd are the same as in an other uni. ie. lack of transparency for gpa/scoring, self studying required using outside materials(google , youtb). also no ragrets. oh but if you do care the gender ratio is 40/60 as the peak benchmark, it will probably be less than that."
is_a_act,2,"Alumni here. No regrets joining, though from what I can tell the school's changed since I entered. Mostly changed to fit the model corporate idea of good workers - profs have admitted that they've been pressured not to give too many A's so that employers ""know who's better"" - as if we can't have a cohort where more than X% is deserving of an A simply by the fact that they know their shit. (admittedly - SUTD is a uni that's supposed to pump out good employees - you can see that by their ""applied"" focus and how much attention there is on industry knowledge and so on, but i still hate that they care more about making students' lives worse than about making sure they learn)

I guess that mirrors my reflections on the school as a whole, being more focused on making us good workers rather than focusing on the learning (not that another uni would've been better, but it just feels sad to see the forces of ""industry"" changing things for their purposes when i would've enjoyed learning for the sake of learning). I learned to stop caring about my numbers so much and to keep them vaguely reasonable while making sure i learn what i can. which i guess is what i'm doing at work now; keeping my project deliverables reasonably on time and balancing that with other ventures instead of keeping a perfect score on everything.

I realise I'm straying from your question - the main regrets would be that I tried too hard to get a 4.5 GPA and that I didn't spend enough time in the fab lab doing things I enjoyed. There was a lot of time wasted trying to get 4.5 so I could get the ""summa cum laude"" title on my resume (which I've only used to apply to 2 places? I don't even remember if my GPA was on my second application) when it could've been spent with friends, making stuff - doing the things I enjoyed. 

If you're looking for reasons not to go to SUTD, it'd be small things like how some people think you're from a private uni (which, i mean, realistically doesn't matter past your first job), and the long commute if you don't live in the east (combined with the near impossibility of getting to hostel - or maybe that has changed). Apart from that, i'd say go for it."

Usual_Accountant6552,1,"Hello! I am in CSD but just started y2 so may not have the best insights. In my perspective, most of the courses taught in year 1 is irrelevant to the CSD pillar. Like for the core courses in CSD, only one subject “10.014 Computational Thinking for Design” in Term 1 is the prerequisite out of the many many courses we are forced to clear in year 1. As such, I feel like they are unnecessarily cramping all the relevant courses in the next 2 years. Not sure if it is a disadvantage, I think we will probably learn everything necessary by the 3.5 year course even though the first year is rather redundant and could have been used to be slowly teach the relevant courses. Am not sure of how it works in NUS/NTU and SMU though."
huixiang01,3,"My question to you is whether you want a good internship. Ofc sch can put you in an internship, whether you learn from it and have a good exp is another story. During COVID, some UROP becomes internship. And I heard a couple of stories of bad internships like free labour (it is a headache to handle), staying in office just doing nothing but to let time past or hard labour.

Ofc not saying all are bad... But still.. would you want to limit your choices?

Best is to self source rather than rely on people. After all, it is your uni exp."
huixiang01,5,"Depends. 

Some prof can chat with you on lesson materials (sometime write essay) on telegram, in some cases instant reply.

Some of the prof just downright busy. So you would probably need to push a bit more. Usually they won't zao after the class, cus people confirm will ask some questions (ofc take note of your assignment deadline lo... If you want to wait a week for lesson, is it a good choice?)

Some prof may just act accordingly due to the complexity of the situation, esp 3.007, 30.007 and capstone. The hardcore projects. Esp when it becomes very political.

In some cases, prof are not the expert of the things you are asking, and they may refer you to another prof... Yes.. the lead time are sometimes great.

In some cases, prof does not give good answer. But, take note that prof are not all-knowing being too. You must use some sort of critical thinking to get the answer you want.

9Brkr,5,"I'm not from CSD but based on my understanding, you are not allowed to graduate with multiple tracks. You may fulfill the prerequisite mods that cover multiple tracks, but you are only allowed to choose one that appears on your transcript.


The track determines what mods you can or cannot take and may give you priority slots when bidding/choosing mods each term (but generally there's no limit to class sizes, just minimum enrollment). You'll have to check the course matrices to determine if the mods you are interested in can be taken for your track of choice, but do take note that the matrices will constantly be updated due to introduction/removal of courses and alumni feedback"

amey_wemy,5,"Hello! I'm an early matriculated student, so term has not started for me yet. Take the following statements with a pinch of salt. Any seniors, feel free to correct me if I'm wrong.


The thing with data science is that, are you interested in the field/industry, or are you interested in becoming a data scientist?

Data scientist roles generally require postgraduate degrees. With companies like Grab having around 40/60 of their data scientists being doctors (phd holders). 
Granted, a lot of companies now are using the ""Data Scientist"" name for bachelors, but many tend to be borrowing algos instead of tweaking them or going to the extent of creating them. (Then again, the goal is simply to meet the company's needs, so ML may not always be necessary)


I'd like to add that in SUTD, ESD is the more ideal route to become a data scientist (best is a mix of ESD and CSD, be it ESD major with CSD minor or CSD major with ESD minor). ESD has more of the math side and business application compared to the programming/theoretical side in CSD. Although CSD provides other options like cyber security, more towards swe etc.

Talked to a senior in DSA, he doesn't have that good of an impression about it and recommends me to head to Sch of Computing's Business Analytics instead. (He was from the original DSA, now with CHS, it'll be different bah). But then again, this could just be the ""grass is greener on the other side"" mentality.

I can't seem to remember what the career paths for DSA are (be it enter bza/data analyst roles, swe roles or postgrad). Will comment on this once I have it clarified."
looshua,4,"Hi!

I'm an EPD student who graduated like 3 years ago (I'm doing software now if that matters at all) while CSD was still called ISTD.

Most of my CSD friends managed to land good jobs by / close to graduation, mostly as software engineers. Statistics from the school I guess should be a pretty good gauge of what's actually happening.

Regarding institution reputation, I actually haven't found a situation where that really matters. Chances are, if a company has hired an SUTD graduate before, they probably won't mind another one. I have had friends get hired from the work they've put up on GitHub too, so I'd think being able to demonstrate software design ability might be more of an advantage compared to good grades.

Lastly, I had an absolute blast in SUTD! While the projects and schoolwork can get quite overwhelming at times, there's always fun activities to do and people to hang out with. You'll start your education there with a common curriculum, which means everyone in your class attends the same lessons. You'll definitely be able to make friends and have a great time.

Hope this helps!"
huixiang01,2,"Just a perspective. I was intending to do computing... but I realised computing is not my passion. I just don't like the culture in computing ba (not dissing computing in any way here, just my own perferrence) The good thing about sutd, at least, you got your first year to really decide whether you want computing (since it is a common engineering year), else you have to suffer with that degree."

Novel_Software5713,1,"Facing the same dilemma as OP. Deciding between CHS DSA and SUTD CSD. From what I have researched, seems like DSA is more narrow in term of the job you can find compared to a cs degree. But from the GES, both seems to be performing well. Personally, I enjoyed math(stats) and coding, hence, I wouldn’t mind both. My only concern was that, seems that for SUTD, we will be spending 3 terms on common subjects and there are only 5 core CS modules over the next 2 terms, not sure if that will be enough to prepare me for the future(though my friends in NUS CS joked that I would only need to learn algorithms to be a software engineer). For NUS, however, from the comments I read, seems like many also disliked the CHS curriculum as it forces you to take some “unwanted” mods? But it’s still NUS, kinda everyone’s childhood dream school. 

It will be good if anyone can share if it’s true that for a cs degree, the school that you graduate from actually doesn’t matter but it’s more about the projects and experience. In that case, why does NUS CS perform so much better in the GES?"

Putrid-Addition-4885,3,"1.Try your best to persuade the interviewer that SUTD is where you 100% rlly rlly want to be. If you're from JC ull def be asked abt ur PW experience so be prepared to talk a lil about that.

Seewhy3160,3,"The interviewer i got is really friendly for the innovation by design masters programme.

I talked to them about the types of design projects i had in my undergrad at NUS. 

I am in my 2nd semester for the programme now. I think they accepted me because of how i really want to improve people's lives via innovation and demonstrated them in earlier projects.

I think they will ask you questions about what you are going to study and see if you align with school values and values of your programme.

Do take a look at their mission and values at their home page."
Snoo_92581,3,"Hey bro! What I would recommend is going through a set process to prepare for the interview. 

Step 1: 

Go through the standard questions that most university interviewers ask? E.g why do you want to study here at SUTD? See the general structure of good responses to these questions, get a feel of how good responses are structured. 

Step 2:

List down your strengths (leadership skills, entrepreneurship, social intelligence) and tangible evidence for these qualities. 

E.g if you say you love trying new things and challenging your comfort zone “I am generally a more reserved person but I decided that I wanted to brush up on my public speaking skills, so I volunteered to participate in an inter school debate competition”. 

Step 3:

Do your research on the course in SUTD which you are interested in and list down the characteristics of the individual they are looking for. Look up the University’s general ethos and mission statement.

Step 4:

List down your achievements and do a write up on each of them. Framing each achievement in a way that lines up with the characteristics researched in step 3 

Step 5:

Rehearse in your head getting asked questions at the interview and confidently putting out your unique selling points as an individual (I.e team player, focussed, adventurous).  

I am was fortunate enough to receive the STEP scholarship from SUTD (architecture as main pillar) matriculating this year. Look up YouTube on how to ace interviews watch multiple videos to get a feel of how competent individuals present themselves). 

Prepare comprehensively and the confidence in the interview will come as a byproduct (mediating and relaxing 10mins before does wonders too) All the best!"

I didn’t go bootcamp however, so just take this w a pinch of salt. 

Go beg your classmates for their notes or your roommate for your subject help. The profs in SMT are generally very nice and theres a good chance they were your T1 profs as well so go seek academic guidance from them as well. No shame already, just whack ba

When it comes to this exam, I would say that its (most likely?) a pass/fail exam so you already know you aren’t out there to earn ALL marks, just enough to pass. Find out where which topics are your boon and bane, work out a strategy and plan accordingly ahead of time.

Im gonna assume that you have a cheat sheet as well. What i did in my first year was that i literally plastered the certain steps of the ans key of my hw/rev of a certain topic idk on my cheatsheet, so i could just literally copy paste the steps on a qn (assuming its basic enough). It wont get you anywhere in knowledge, but wtv works to get you out of here, right

Quick tips tho. 

1. Bookmark itservicedesk.sutd.edu.sg
There's promotions, quick links, essential programs to downloads, etc

2. Can't reset / unlock your account? Server not operating? Probably using the old site that is still up for some reason. Use the EASE portal for that.

3. Outlook not working?
The webmail should probably still work. Log into Ease and you should still be able to use.

4. Account lock out? Use your phone to unlock your account via EASE
There is a button under ""Login"" that says ""Need help signing in"" 
U can reset / unlock there.

5. New phone who dis. 
If still have old phone, keep it to register your new phone.

Died? Just call / email the helpdesk.


6. You really just need 2 websites to redirect to most of the other sites.

actuallyidk_,3,"It's pretty chill and felt more like a conversation/chat than an interview. There will be two interviewers; for me one was a prof and the other was the admin head of something. 

They will definitely ask you about the things you wrote in your application. e.g. you wrote about doing community service, they may ask what exactly you did and what did you learn from it. If you stated a pillar you're interested in, they will ask about that too.

I selected ASD in my application and they asked me something along the lines of 'A lot of students who want ASD feel that learning so much math and physics and other engineering subjects in year 1 is not relevant to their pillar and a waste of time. What are your thoughts on that?'

Also questions about group work.

If you want to prepare, then list your past experiences (CCA, VIA, PW etc), especially 'learning points'. (like your PW group fought then how did u resolve it) Because they like to see personal development. If you have coding background or something they may ask technical questions (not me  but my friends).

There is a math MCQ quiz at the end lol"
piatos22,4,"If you'd want to go SUTD with an interest in Graphic Design, you'd probably end up in the Architecture (ASD) Course. Search for Computational Design Architecture in google/youtube and see if it's your cup of tea.

You may also end up in Computer Science and Design (CSD), if you might end up liking the kind of animated graphic design that's happening in the Crypto/NFT space, you need programming knowledge for that. Graphic design is not the focus of CSD though, so bear that in mind.

You need to make sure that your level of interest in the topic is enough to fuel your motivation to go through 1 year of learning Calculus and Python/Rhino-Grasshopper programming because you only go into the Architecture major after 1 year of the common Freshmore modules. Otherwise, it's going to be very, very tough.

Otherwise, there's this 1 Year graphic design school in Singapore that has alumni working in big game/digital media companies:

[https://www.youtube.com/user/FZDSCHOOL](https://www.youtube.com/user/FZDSCHOOL)

source: Am a Term 4 student"
amey_wemy,4,"Incoming student here, these are some info I've heard from seniors:
1. Never heard of anyone not getting their pillar of choice, generally very safe.
2. Term 1 is fully S/U (pass/fail), however upon failure u have to go for bootcamp. Term 2 you can choose to S/U 2 out of 4 of ur mods. No more S/U from then on. Although term 3 is considered freshmore, u get to choose ur own electives.

You can check out the freshmore subjects, EPD (engi product) would see the most relevancy, however there r quite a number of math/computing mods. If I recall correctly, mainly the 2 physics mod and the Chem/Bio mod (its 1 mod), is irrelevant. The rest are math/computing or hass, which can be chill.

Compared to the other unis, u may not hv as many computing mods in year 1, but the math mods definitely dont lose out. Term 2 covers linear algebra and multivariable calculus already. Granted term 3 computing mod covers OOP, which is done in NUS' Programming Methology 2, and has abit of ML.

Head's up, from what I've seen, the SUTD curriculum is more suited for JC student., Its very rigorous and quite a few poly students may find it harder than the other universities considering you cover alot of JC content in freshmore (as mentioned about term 2 math, those stuff arent covered in jc, so most of the jc knowledge is already done in term 1, and maybe the term 3 probability/stats mod)

On the bright side u hv quite a few ""IT"" related courses such as CSD, DAI and ESD (honestly feels more like data analytics from what I've seen)."
rcRollerCoaster,3,">How likely are you to be given your pillar of choice?

(And there's new courses that have come out/will be coming out, which have yet to be reviewed on the sheet too.)

In addition, you can ask the seniors around you (maybe those you know from Fifth Rows?) for their reviews. I think that's where most students get their information from, via word-of-mouth. You could go further and encourage your peers to fill up the Google Sheet as they go along too, if you want to help make this information more accessible to everyone.

I agree that the course's instructor is a really important factor as well as the workload, but you can also narrow down courses by your own personal interest in the class. You could be taking a class from an amazing prof with a very manageable workload, but if you're not at all interested in the content/field, it could be a struggle."

laughoutloud1o1,2,"1. Just add it in sounds like good experiences to add regardless of the school you are applying for
2. Doesn't matter that much, you are not committed to a pillar when you apply, you are applying to SUTD at the end of the day. u only need to choose pillar by term 4 (decision in mid term 3 but final decision by term 4) so you have time before that to ask seniors and decide based on what you r comfortable with.
given that DAI is a new course, i think its best that you just join first and ask seniors how it goes. 
3. yea u r kinda right about the 3 sciences thing but i would say they kinda cover enough basics but they move fast. However, profs are rly nice and if u need consultation and help, find them fast and u should do ok
4. No idea sorry (Maybe dont worry too much about it?)
5. yea it is pretty chill, just come and go from every CCA as you wish but i would say its best if you commit to 1 or 2, makes the experience better but no one will force you to stay. at least i think so.

godkillwhatiknow,2,"Hi, I’m from the year before you. I technically haven’t been to boot camp my self but here’s a few things I rmb from last year:
1. They’ll mail to those who have to go to the boot camp either next week or the week after that. Usually it’s pretty soon after the finals
2. I don’t really know about the boot camp format, but many profs say that the overall assessment (attendance, exam, etc.) was made easy enough so that students couldn’t fail even if they try to cause the profs don’t really want to fail anyone
3. Attending boot camp wouldn’t affect ur transcript in T1. If u pass boot camp, it’ll just show pass in ur transcript like everyone else. From term 2 tho, I heard it will be shown as a C (or the equivalent minimum passing grade) in ur transcript.
4. In my year, i heard that 10% of the student with lowest score in a subject will be called for boot camp for said subject. So if u know how many students there are in ur batch, u can calculate. But yeah, not sure if they change it for your batch tho"
9Brkr,2,"I just graduated, went for math bootcamp after term 1. Iirc results came out the Wednesday following exam week. They will mail those who are required to attend bootcamp as a notification. I remember the test itself being much easier than finals and I managed to do majority of the paper. Format for the exam was the same as finals (math was questions and blank space for working). I'm not sure about passing requirements but I believe passing (i.e. 50%) is the minimum. Don't take my word for it though - check with the profs. 

Isn't term 1 pass/fail? For my intake it was and my transcript just reflects all subjects for that term as 'P' (as opposed to the usual A, B+ etc). Around 20-odd people showed up for the math bootcamp. For other terms that were graded, I think you'll be assigned a C grade if you pass bootcamp. Once you go to pillar year, there's no more bootcamp safety net and you can score as low as a D. I'll leave you to work out what's the points in a D. 

Don't worry too much about failing now. Its the start of your journey and you'll have many ways to find what you're good at."
huixiang01,2,"Not the best for me. Cus my teammates just do other things, meaning they hard ghost me. (Like they are given task to do, and they blatantly ignore, saying that they are busy with academics and stuff)

Sometimes, cold emailing works... I mean if it is worth the try. Nothing to lose too

But best is to consult the prof the things you are interested and ask for the opportunities. Prof here quite willing to help. Sometimes, prof don't reply and mostly cus they miss the email, so maybe a ping is sufficed.

Or maybe go to maker clubs (soar, studio, etc.) And ping the seniors there to get a prof. (Yes, a bit shameless, but if you want it, you gotta get it)

Experience wise, we are pretty much YOLO and learn on the spot. I think prof welcome help that they can get. For front door application, I believe that the admin side has already categorise whether it is urop or urop+ (meaning is it for freshie and above, or sophomore and above)"

HypothesisTesting,2,"I heard from a friend in another local uni that one of their friends transferred to SUTD after a year in the other uni, studying a completely different major. So it is possible, though I suppose the number of people who transfer universities is not very large to begin with and so we don't hear of many such stories? I doubt you'll be at a disadvantage just for transferring; there's a lot more factors to applications.

I think you should push through with your application! If I'm not wrong it's free to apply too (compared to like $10/$15 for other local unis???), so the only cost is really just time and opportunity cost. Worst case, at least you'll have started putting together a portfolio if you haven't already, which will come in handy regardless of your application's outcome."
huixiang01,1,"to be honest, i dont see a lot of applicants here that have taken undergraduate studies before, as credits are not transferrable.

Many core mods are analytics related such as ""The Analytics Edge"" and ""Data and Business Analytics"". Whereas EPD is more of the traditional physical engineering like mechanical, electrical etc.

2. From what I know all pillars are built on from the freshmore subjects, so no background is required. But being an engineering school, having a background in STEM is ideal.

4. You can add anything to the application, if u're targetting ESD/EPD, maybe some projects would be good (this is purely based on options, no one truly knows)

5. IB curriculum should be applicable to all Singaporean Universities, so SATs shouldnt be a requirement, but it can be a good addition to give a better gauge of your understanding"
Spagetee,2,Ib score depends on whr u from and subject combo. There is not officially set req subjects but uh math and physics hl are nice to have and are pretty much required if u want to survive. If ur nov IB then not as nessicary cos u can do ilp classes which cover term 1 math and physics. may ib glhf  if you dont have math and/or physics hl. Ib score wise to be safe id say 34-36 min ofc higher better. But they mainly seem to look at math and science  scores. sats unless u got ivyleague level dont bother trying sg uni dont care abt them. documents same regardless of eventual pillar choice but if u got interesting stuff you did thats related to them then include it. As for standing out being in Ib alr helps w that kek.

HypothesisTesting,11,"Hello! I'm an ESD alumni, although not in the data analytics field now (personal preference). I did not take the ISTD Data Analytics (DA) courses, so it'd be great if someone who with experience there could fill in!

Anyway, I had the same dilemma as you back in Freshmore, I couldn't decide between ESD and ISTD (the pillar that offers the CSD degree), especially since the Data Analytics track was newly-introduced in ISTD. At the time, a senior described it as ""do you want to learn the math behind it, or are you happy calling libraries?"" Tbh, I don't know how true statement that is, but I went for ESD because I wanted to learn the math since it's the backbone of data analytics. To me, knowing the math meant that I would know what I was actually doing, and not just randomly punching in some numbers and hoping for the best. (Though whether I succeeded, is another question, haha.)

Also, in ESD, it seemed like analytics was built into the core, rather than 'tacked-on' as in ISTD electives (again, would be great if someone from ISTD/CSD can clear this up). At a virtual ESD welcome session last year (to welcome the Term 4 ESD students), ESD's Pillar Head, Peter Jackson, described ESD as ""data science, decision science, \[something I forgot\], logistics, finance, \[more things I forgot\],"" and I found that it made a lot of sense. To be fair though, ISTD is Information Systems, which encompasses more than analytics, so it only makes sense that the ISTD core is not as analytics-focused as ESD.

I did have an ESD friend who took a bunch of ISTD data-related electives, and they felt that there was a lot of overlap in Term 6, describing 40.016 and 50.038 as similar, just in different programming languages (though there are still non-overlapping concepts taught in both).

Additionally, I think what's really important is picking a good internship. I don't have much relevant advice for this, except that you should look for an industry/sector you're interested in working in as much as possible; domain knowledge goes a long way. It'll also be helpful to start looking up data analytics job listings now, so you have an idea of what sort of experience and skills employers are looking out for, and maybe that could help inform you of your pillar choice.

Having graduated, I would describe ESD as a way of thinking (""design, analyse, optimise"") that can be applied to different industries/sectors. You can see this in how ESD's focus tracks are industries (aviation and urban infrastructure, supply chain, finance, and biz and OR), compared to ISTD's focus tracks being specialisations (AI, DA, fintech, IoT, cybersec, and visual analytics). Hell, you could probably apply ESD to ASD/EPD/ISTD/DAI/HASS/SMA.

If I had to choose my pillar again (wanting to go into data analytics), I think I would still choose ESD, with ISTD electives. Then again, I do have a biased perspective, so I would take my own statement with a pinch of salt, haha.

Hope this makes sense!"
dteo96,2,"Anecdotally I remember it was about 3-5 students per class of 50.

Prefacing any suggestions, to start would be to say, I can understand how stressful it feels to fail exams. 

Since you performed poorly for the midterms, what I can suggest is maybe adopting different modes of learning? For example if you studied solely from the notes maybe you can try to make your own notes, find friends to explain the content to you or book consultation slots with the profs."

hohouyj,5,"I know this is probably off topic, but your baggage will follow you wherever you go. And expecting a geographical change to help you get rid of it may be a bit naïve.

There are no true new starts, and that's not a bad thing, you get to carry with you all the things you have learnt and experienced. Hopefully becoming a better person.

I would say if it were me I would want to spend as much time that I have with my aging grandmother, and thus choose to stay in SG. Exchanging a unique and valuable experience for one I deem more precious.

I think the answer to your question lies in yourself. Give yourself some time and really think about what you want out of the 4 years. I know that if you are honest and open with yourself, you will make the right choice."

galaxyuser,6,"You could matriculate early, and have access to some special summer programmes (SSP) that begin in May and end in Aug. You could take Term 1 Math mod “Modelling and Analysis” or Physics mod “The Physical World”, plus up to 2 Humanities and Social Sciences (HASS) modules borrowed from pillar years, that count towards Term 8 mod fulfilment (meaning to say if you take it during SSP, you can take one less HASS mod when Term 8 comes, and this is very helpful because Capstone that spans an entire 2 terms will be a real pain to deal with, trust me).

I went through SSP, along with several of my batch mates, mainly due to the delay of our official undergraduate commencement by 1 whole term from May 2020 to Sep 2020 as a result of the situation of the pandemic at the time of the decision being made by the university.

It definitely eased much of the pressure when Term 1 came around as i only needed to do the remaining 3 modules, having done 1 module in the SSP prior. Many will be jealous of you having extra free time (upwards of around 5 hours per week), but that being said, the 2D cross-module project would still require your participation though, so it’s not like you’re completely void of any duties for the module you took in SSP. That said, the 2D component will only apply to your other 3 modules, and not the module you’ve already taken before Term 1.

Some would say SSP variant of the Term 1 modules offered (Math or Physics) is a “cheese” version, or a simplified version with better weightages and being comparatively easier to score.

These are my own personal observations drawn from the SSP experience. Feel free to weigh the benefits and opportunity costs of taking SSP.

You could of course decide to partake in part-time or contract work to bridge the gap between your previous endeavour or commitment, and the upcoming Term 1. I assume you are due for the 2022 matriculation cycle.

UPDATED EDIT: I realise the SSP is no longer available for batches from 2021 onwards. There are, however, SS Integrated Learning Programmes to help bridge the gap between JC/Poly education standard and the impending educational rigour needed for the undergraduate programme here in SUTD."

OCBC - 1 No (not really no but accepting the offer would delay employment by a year)

SUTD - 1 Yes (me :P)

I am actually unsure of how the employment rates are computed. It could also indicate a number of ESD students pursing further studies? Another reason could be that a higher proportion of ESD students tend to have side hustles, and could be working on those after graduation."
amey_wemy,1,"From what I know, a large proportion of students are from CSD/ISTD.
And CSD/ISTD along with ESD are very much accessible to the financial sector due to business/data analytics and software development.
Not to mention that engineers can be accepted into finance, so the 26% of jobs based on internships are very much possible.

SUTD's permanent employment rate is at 85.4% which isn't too far off from the other unis such as NTU with 86.1% and SMU at 83.9% (for non-cum laude). Granted, NUS is at 92.6%, however its clear they're the anomality."

2. Personal Opinion  
Personally feel that it is up to the individuals to make the differences. Professors are quite committed, I must say. Consultation is q free flow. Lessons are mostly manageable. If you are the overzealous kind who wants to make a difference like in MIT, I think prof here are quite open to changes, you just have to propose to profs who are interested (I think simple email will do. Prof usually looks in the email de.) For research-wise, SUTD upholds interdisciplinar-ism, so you may not have profs who are very deep in niche areas of research, but I would say that what they research is pretty close to what the industry needs ba. Of course, if you want to make difference, not all are smooth-sailing. Just have to deal with failures and carry on if you see them as desired."

9Brkr,2,"It was a necessity for me. 


I matriculated and started orientation, and the school issued me a temporary red card to use. The card's CAN number is tagged to each student and is what allows you to tap and unlock rooms with maglocks (granted you already are allowed access to the room you're trying to enter), such as entering hostel and the fablab. 


What I didn't realise back then was they expected me to eventually get the DBS card, and my temp card had its access revoked, so I was essentially locked out of every room I originally had access to. I tried to get the access extended, but the facilities management people said I was only allowed to extend up to a week/month (can't remember), so I eventually had to open a DBS account just for the card, instead of paying regular visits to the facilities management office"

Playful-Word5086,4,"hello, from my experience, i wouldn't say that it is lonely or depressing. i've had a great first 2 terms so far and my classmates are all really chill. initially the whole class kind of hangs out together but as time passes, everyone will start forming their own smaller group of friends ( which is actually only natural human behaviour imo ) and they will spend most of their time with this smaller group of friends. 

&#x200B;

but you will always make friends outside of your class, such as from fifth-rows and other extracurricular projects, although making friends from fifth-rows have been quite limited for me due to the covid restrictions, hopefully it gets better for your batch.   


workload during term 1 was very manageable for me, term 2 was a lot more demanding, especially with the infamous design mod known as 3.007. it really takes up a lot of your time, especially if your group chooses to create something big. the 2nd half of term 2 is really quite hellish as most people would have to choose to spend their time between focusing on 3.007 or studying for finals, it's a choice that you have to make. just grind through those 3 weeks and then enjoy the insanely long 4+ months of break afterwards haha.

HypothesisTesting,2,"Hi, I took the EWET back in 2018, I'm not sure if things have changed since then, but I'll contribute what I can remember.

It was a 1.5-hours test in an LT (or was it an hour long?), and if I'm not wrong it was basically a mix of GP Paper 1 and GP AQ, if you're familiar with the 'A' Levels. For those who aren't, basically it's an essay for us to discuss a given topic. (Though, I can't remember if a strictly argumentative essay was expected. But I don't think it makes a big difference in answering your question about what the EWET is.) There's no right or wrong answer, they just want to see how you argue and your command of English. I don't know of anyone who failed it, and I don't think you will fail unless your English is really atrocious. (That's what my OGLs told me at least.)

And also, while I did say it was a mix of GP Paper 1 and GP AQ, I really cannot remember if we were merely given a topic to talk about, or a passage to read as a springboard. I think it's the latter, but it's been over three years!"

The topics that would be asked in UEE are based on A-level Maths and Physics.

zungedous,3,"Just graduated from the PhD programme a while back, here are my responses:

**Research Experience:** I really appreciated the interdisciplinary nature of SUTD which not only helped a lot in building one's academic portfolio but also gave a chance to interact with people from specialisations might not even typically talk to. This is especially so if your advisor's research team is comprised of researchers or other PhD students from various backgrounds, which helps in understanding how others think or do research. 

**Faculty**: Most faculty are very approachable and willing to help or collaborate with you, even if you are from a different pillar. I think this is bolstered by the fact that SUTD is still rather young and have hired a number of recent PhD graduates whom are open to trying out new things in their career. In fact, I feel that most profs are open-minded and are more willing to share the details of their own research, even in casual conversation. 

**Hurdles**: That said, most hurdles which I faced during my research would be dealing with certain admin departments. In general, getting approvals for *certain* matters might take more time than you would expect, in a university setting, which might hinder your research schedule. So it's best to factor that in if your research is 'less conventional' than the norm, especially when charting your research timeline.

**Internships**: Depends on your pillar. It's more mandatory for EPD track, but less so for ASD. I'm uncertain about ESD, ISTD or HASS though. 

As for international internships, I guess this is dependent on your contacts and subject to approval from the grad student office. Of course, the one greatest obstacle is overcoming Covid restrictions right now since Singapore (and even SUTD) is rather conservative in dealing with this.

Hope this helps and feel free to DM me if you need more info."
ryanndelion,2,"Hi, currently am phd student in sutd. To briefly answer your questions:

1) Research experience so far has been good. The school makes a lot of resources available and there are ample opportunities for collaboration.

2) Overall culture is friendly, though perhaps less close knit these days due to most people working from home. From the short time I spent in and around campus in my first year it was a very pleasant experience. The faculty members are generally really great as well, and are very approachable.

3) I believe all phds have to do at least 1 internship/research attachment, usually in the 3rd or 4th year. International internships might be hard to come by given covid though.

One thing I feel could be a very subjective matter is the size of the student body. Being from a very small pillar, we only have a few students every year and although this results in us being closer as colleagues and friends, it does result in resource pooling (i.e. sometimes courses are not available to us because there are only going to be 3 people taking the course if it were offered). Other than that sort of minor issue my experience has been positive so far."

1. It is pretty much a guarantee to be on the student helper scheme if you have a good working relationship with a prof, and demonstrate willingness to SHOW UP. Literally heard of too many stories where people signed up for UROP and list it on their portfolio despite only turning up for the first meeting. You need to specifically ask to be on the student helper instead of UROP scheme though. This pays 10/h and the number of hours worked is based on trust. I always submit a claim with a nominal 32h/mth worked. You can put up to 64h but I wouldn't recommend it as it may come off as taking advantage of the system.
2. You can elect to take an internship during both summer holidays, generally pay ranges from a 800 to 1.5k per month. As for jobs during the school term, some common jobs are
   1. Sales (insurance/real estate/MLM etc). Income mostly commission based, ranges from 0-10k/mth.
   2. Tutoring (1-1 tutoring jobs are easy to find. If you want to have more flexibility and ownership you may choose to do group tuition like I did. The 3 common forms of group tuition are via zoom, renting a classroom or getting them to go to your place of residence). This pays anywhere between 25-70/h.
   3. ecommerce. Anecdotally, my sister was able to provide for her expenses during her studies by marketing anime related merchandize online.
   4. Part time retail. Some of my friends worked at yoghurt/BBT outlets at an hourly rate of 12/h. I'm certain its higher than average due to my friend having prior experience or taking on extra roles besides sales.
   5. Food delivery. A more recent addition to the pool of common jobs students take, this also provides quite a good source of income as well as exercise if that's something you are into. The average earnings amount to 5-10 per trip.
3. Don't quote me on this but people who know me would know I spent about 10-15h a week on anything related to school =). The average would be closer to 30-40h though. Pretty much wasted my time playing dota for 5h or more a day. I'm sure there are a minority who also treated uni as a holiday before the real work starts.
4. Definitely does not affect your chances as a student helper at all. I was on the undergrad merit scholarship and was a student helper.
5. What? I believe you are asking on the general thoughts on earning money as an undergrad. I give my seal of approval and say it is 100% possible to earn and also grow your bank balance during uni. A word of caution however, I strongly advise against working in a part time job you dread just for the income as it would take a toll on your mental health.

Thanks for the interesting question. I did enjoy answering it and hope it widens your perspective on the available income options."

huixiang01,4,"**Internship**

Before covid, there are grants available. Esp from istd pillar cus govt wants more computing peeps.

There are also grants for other pillars too. But they are just not fully subsided.

Also some companies do offer some welfare. Haha. Like free accommodation, meals, etc. One example I know is Mitsubishi.

Speaking of which, getting an internship is more of skill level, rather than relying on school to spoon feed.

**Programs**

Yup. Same thing. Before covid, there are also grants. Go through an interview and the profs see whether you are fit for the grant. Think some criteria also weigh on academic and fifth rows too.

The program grant is provided if you do not have concurrent scholarship cus it is treated as one.

**Overall**

So, all of these are on covid situation. But based on like estimation to herd immunity in scientific reports, even developed countries are not going to be out of danger zone any sooner..."

3. I know someone who brought a hot plate. Just keep it on the down low and you’ll be good (dontquotemeonthis)

4. ESD alumni here. Physics is useful if you ask me - maybe some day you’ll be writing a physics simulation and will need that knowledge. Or quantum computing. I’m quite against the mindset that freshmore term is useless but that’s a personal stance that breadth is important. Jc math is important but make sure you understand why the equations work and what they mean. I always recommend 3blue1brown for that sense of understanding. Code (specifically, computational thinking) will help you a lot, considering that computing came out of the field of math (see: charles babbage, alan turing and von neuman - the skills in one field sort of transfer over.)

5. I tried to hang out less w my old friends and figure out who i wanted to be rather than stick to what i was comfortable with. Sometimes a new start is a good time for you to reset and take stock to see if you like who you are and make decisions to become the person you’d like to be."

Most of the time, ppl are too tired/busy to do wild shit, and ppl usually just hang with their close friends so don't expect frat parties.

Aside from that, SUTD hostel is fairly neww so it's actually way nicer and cleaner than this hall u speak of. There's a hostel lounge where u can play foosball, darts and board games. There are pantries where u can cook, and recreational rooms with tv and beanbags if u wanna play yr switch or watch movies. There are house guardians (RA) on each floor, they usually hold floor events so u can get free food and socialise with your floormates. It's a pretty good hostel experience tbh."

armorinfinitus616,8,"Hi there! I am a freshmore so I cant really comment about ISTD. 

1. Lessons in SUTD are not really divided into lectures and tutorials. Rather, we have 2.5hr class lessons (class size ~50). Usually these classes will involve the Profs teaching content, as well as group discussions on solving some questions. The class is more engaging in that sense than a traditional large group lecture. In addition to the Prof teaching at the front, there will usually be another Prof and a Teaching Assistant walking around the class to answer any questions or doubts we have, which is a BIG plus for me. Profs are also very passionate to help and provide guidance regarding academic content and project consultations. Our curriculum also features a project for every module, so its very hands-on and design centric rather than just pure bookwork. For example, for a computing mod, one of our projects was to design mini games using the content taught in class.

2. For labs, it really depends on the module. For example, for Science for Sustainable World (Bio-Chem-environemental mod), we have about 2-3 labs in total, and for Computational Design Thinking (Python programming mod) we had 1 lab session. However, we didnt really have many lab sessions overall.

3. Every mod in SUTD has a project component. Usually, this is known as a 1D project, and takes up anywhere between 20 - 35% of the grades. In addition to projects, we also have Midterms and Final exams, each taking up about 20 - 30% as well. Remaining credit goes to homework/assignments (~10%) and attendance/class participation. It is important to note that the curriculum and thus the assesment in SUTD is very different from other unis, as Finals in NUS or NTU usually take up 50% or more of the overall grade, and not all their mods have a project component. 

4. We take 4 mods per term, and each mod has 2 times 2.5hr classes per week. While this will amount to an average of 2 classes a day, I have had days with 3 lessons in a row! (7.5hrs!!!) In addition, some mods have flipped video lectures that we are to watch over the weekends. Homework assignments are usually due the next week. The most time consuming part though, would be working on our projects!

One additional things to note about SUTD would be the fifth row (CCA) culture. There are very many niche clubs here, such as Electric Vehicle society, many robotics and maker clubs, and also the usual sports and performing arts clubs. The uniqueness is not just in the number of clubs, but also that all CCAs are very welcoming and they do not usually impose trials or selection criteria. We are able to explore our interests and take as many CCAs (as we can cope with hahha). 

I hope my experiences are helpful in answering ur questions and hopefully help you make a more informed decision! :)"
Only-Word-5979,1,Thanks a lot. Very well explained.
amey_wemy,2,"Honestly it depends what programme you're looking for. The traditional sutd programme with the guarantee of GLP (Which means about 3 months in any of the 4 universities depending on performance) or the STEP programme with an additional focus on Entrepreneurship with a guarantee of 1 year overseas to UC Berkeley Extension, Silicon Valley and ZheJiang China with a fixed syllabus focusing on entrepreneurship (granted you can pay to add more mods).

If you're looking at the value of each scholarship, the school believes that the STEP Scholarship super seeds the Global Distinguished Scholarship. However I would not recommend going for STEP only for the small perks (like longer overseas trip etc). You'll be wasting alot of your time if you have no interest in it (not the mention the additional 0.5 years, graduating after the typical cohort). You'll overall save more money with GDS due to the additional $2.5k per term which is not available under the STEP Scholarship.

As a recipient of both the GDS and STEP scholarship before (Initially had GDS before it was replaced by STEP), I only made the decision to change after getting more invested in entrepreneurship such as taking the harvardx online course. Thus realising that the STEP programme is very well tailored to those who aspires to be future entrepreneurs."
googleColdMind,1,"I think STEP if entrepreneurship and the culture of startups or entrepreneurship in big companies. If you rather degree as a means to an end, than GD"
blueberrypie31,2,"Life in SUTD is fun and enriching from the experience I've had so far (only been through Terms 1 and 2 as a Freshmore and now in summer holidays). 

One thing I really like about SUTD is how they encourage people to get along and work together. For your first two terms, it is mandatory to stay in the school hostel. Usually, you would be living on the same floor as your classmates. Being around the same space 24/7 helps to bring you and your classmates together. I know my classmates had study sessions together in dorm rooms and played games together in one of the meeting rooms nearby. Not to mention that fifth rows themselves (basically CCAs) have rather tight-knit communities that welcome anyone with similar interests to join in. So long as you aren't being a general ass (word spreads fast around here), it would be easy to find friends here. 

Workload-wise, I would say it is not so bad so long as you manage your time wisely. Homework and quizzes are submitted usually on a weekly basis. There is a substantial amount of content that the professors go through during class-time and you are expected to read up or view the lectures before coming to class. It is kind of similar to JC in that aspect, with the addition of loads of group projects.  

The curriculum however is still kind of new, so there were some issues regarding how they taught it and/or how the content given was not appropriate for our level. By the time if you choose to enroll though, these issues would be addressed so it probably would not be that big of a problem. Even then, if there are still any, you can voice your complaints to the professors or in the feedback forms they always give at the end of the term. 

Thankfully, you can seek help from either your classmates or your professors if you have any problems regarding understanding content. The professors are generally very nice and open to answering any of your questions (especially prof bernie he's so nice i wish he was my prof ahhhhhhhhhhhh #blessbernie). You can also compare notes with your classmates too and have study sessions together if you are worried about taking too much of profs' time (though like make sure the classmates you go to actually know their stuff lol). 

And that's my summation of how life in SUTD is like. For SUTD admissions, they tend to be more holistic as compared to other universities (at least in my opinion). It is an engineering school so you should be adequate or at least indicate interest to learn physics/math. SUTD is also about collaboration as well so being a team player is very important too. 

Not sure what kind of advice to give you so I'll just end it off here. Hope my rambling helps!."
IIlllIIIllll,10,"Throwaway for reasons. Am an ISTD senior.

It's possible that this is only applicable to ISTD (and also note that if you're a prospective student, it'll likely be quite different for you), but I found the curriculum to be extremely disorganized. In my experience, SUTD's courses primarily operate on a ""shallow but broad"" basis, which has its benefits, but is a terrible strategy for a university. Many courses have huge overlaps in content with each other (which may be more a product of poor communication rather than the course itself). If you're interested in, say, AI, and come up with a study plan that's centered around AI-related courses, you'll just end up learning the basics over and over again. Some courses, such as Introduction to Algorithms in term 4, are lifted almost entirely from MIT OCW ('almost' not because they added, but because they removed some topics). In my opinion, most courses simply do not give students the technical rigour that a university should afford.

Design is the core emphasis of the curriculum, but after having went through seven terms of it - and this may be a highly unpopular opinion - it's mostly just fluff. 'Design' is integrated into the curriculum mainly by assigning 'design' projects each term, with the 'design' part simply meaning that you have to also produce a poster for your project. Don't get me wrong, good design is vital to the success of any product. But there is very little concrete teaching on what actually makes good design and how to achieve it for specific courses and topics; instead, the times when it's mentioned mostly involve cargo-culting around some abstract design processes and practices (""double diamond"", for instance)."
Any-Background-7568,8,Freshmore 3 terms
oneminuteprogramming,3,no regrets 😁😁😁
pqycxx,1,canteen food
HypothesisTesting,6,"Hello! I'll answer some of your questions:

1. No one knows, we'll have to see how the situation evolves and what guidelines the ministries provide. If the government calls for Circuit Breaker 2.0, then we have no choice but to follow that; the AY2019 Freshmores were kicked out of hostel when Circuit Breaker was announced, halfway through their Term 3. As far as possible, I'm sure SUTD will try to get Freshmores on campus (they were prioritised for physical classes, everyone else had to take a backseat), and if staying in hostels is permitted, Freshmores are guaranteed a room. Of course, you can choose to not stay in, literally the only requirement is paying the hostel fees each term.
2. No one likes a freeloader, most people will play their part, with varying effectiveness (some people come in with lots of experience under their belt, while others may struggle with the course content, so it's also important to ensure work is distributed according to everyone's strengths and weaknesses). Of course, there are bad eggs who don't do anything, but you can inform the profs and give them poor reviews in peer reviews. Regarding proactiveness, not everyone is a leader la, but most people will try to get their job done. I wouldn't say you have to tank, but you do need to learn to delegate and find ways to ensure people complete their work if it really comes down to that. But if that fails, then yeah I guess you'll have to tank.
3. Depends on what you find important. Personally, I'm not in any special programme, but I'm not interested in any of them anyway so to me, it's worth it. There are also other avenues to pursue research/entrepreneurship if you're interested in them, but I'm not interested in them so I can't provide any personal experiences.
4. Depends on what a ""good internship"" means to you I guess. If you mean big names, I would think that those are hard to get anyway. But since your question mentions ""as an SUTD student"", I'm guessing you're comparing between being an SUTD student and being an SIT (or other unis) student? I personally don't think being a student from any particular university gives you an edge (though maybe it can be argued that you do have an edge over private unis? I don't know), it's more on your portfolio and skillsets and even your personality. And regarding portfolio, SUTD has a lot of projects built into the curriculum that you can add to your portfolio and talk about in interviews, and that could help. But overall, I could be wrong about the whole having an edge thing, take what I say here with a pinch of salt.
5. As often as you want, depending on whether the faculty member wants to take you in or not. There's also self-initiated UROPs you can propose. Usually calls to sign up for UROPs take place in the first few weeks of the term, maybe even the preceding break. But it could be possible for you to hop onto a UROP after the registration if you know the faculty, but this is kinda a back door thing and by no means a guarantee of getting into a UROP or being recognised for it.
6. Don't know, I'm an average student who doesn't ask around for people's grades. In terms of bell curve, I hear different stories from different people, so I can't say for sure either. But what's consistent and quite known is that there's a limit on the number of A's that can be given out for any given mod.
7. I cannot answer this question satisfactorily.
8. Without having physical classes, it's a bit hard to say. The pandemic feels like it's dampened everything, but I feel that in all aspects of my life, so I wouldn't say you can take my word for it. But people are generally quite friendly, not necessarily extroverted. I guess it also really depends on the people you mix with; there are people who regularly go out for drinks, and there are people who are in the go-home club. I'm a relatively quiet person, and quite introverted at that (my social battery was usually dead by the end of Thursday back in Freshmore), and I think I'm doing okay with the few close friends I have. And even then, it's not too difficult to talk to my less-close friends or even acquaintances!

Hope this helps! Let me know if there's anything I can further clarify or if there's any other question you may have."
twilightxx_,5,"hello! currently a freshie at SUTD who just finished term 2 so i might be able to provide some insights but probs not super indepth. maybe some seniors can help to chip in!

1. we did have hostel stay from term 1 - term 2 last year cuz i think by then the covid situation was much more chill and singapore moved to phase 2 by then. so hopefully, if all things go well by the start of the sept term, hostel stay would still apply for freshies for the first 2 terms :). it’s probably one of the biggest highlights of my freshie terms so far :”

2. i would say that grp projects here r definitely much much more than what you would see in NUS, NTU and SMU bc in SUTD, every module would have at least 1-2 projects (be it big or small ones) bc SUTD believes in hands-on learning and collaboration as compared to the normal lectures and tutorials in the big 3. personally, i have encountered challenging teammates, but most of the time, the people within your grp r more than willing to put in the effort to complete their tasks. 

3. i don’t hold any SHARP or STEP scholarships actly HAHA. but i find it a worthwhile journey bc i think SUTD teaches u alot of soft skills through grp projects and all aside from the hard skills which r useful for the industry next time!

4. i’m not too sure about this. maybe some seniors can answer this qn! but i think that securing internships for SUTD students shld be quite manageable especially since our pillars r v broad and it teaches us skills that allow us to venture into many industries of our preference.

5. u can participate anytime! as long as there’s a UROP open and u fit in the criteria, you can participate. u can even propose your own UROPs that u r interested in during long vacations too (eg summer vacation etc)

6. i would say it’s not vv easy but if you’re willing to put in the extra effort, it’s definitely doable :) just that for students w little to no physics background, they might have to put in extra work for physics though! i think as much as the profs say that there’s no bellcurve, i still think there is haha.

7. i’m not too certain abt this so maybe some seniors can chip in!

8. i feel like it’s a mix actly! i have friends who r extremely extroverted whr they can’t go a day without hanging out w people but i also have friends who r extremely introverted and prefer to hole themselves up in their hostel rooms haha. i too am quite introverted, but i personally found no issue w making friends there (i’ve actly met some of my closest friends there :”)) i believe that everyone is generally q open and friendly! as long as you’re not an ass or slacker, you’ll generally mingle well w the community :)

pqycxx,7,"i didn’t take physics during a’level, only took it during o’level. got a B3 for pure physics. buT i struggled aLOT in uni. but honestly it is OKAY to struggle bc you can always seek help from your prof, friends & TA. Profs are extremely helpful. Worst come to worst, if you ever fail, just go for the bootcamp, it helps you understand the concept better. 

I don’t think there will be alot of physics in ESD/DAI/ASD. I think you can research more on that. Afterall you will only need to do physics for 2 terms compulsory. Term 3 onwards it’s Math & HASS & 2 other electives. 

But I would say math is quite important and it’s almost in every pillar so you can’t really escape that. All the best in choosing!!"

That being said don't go into uni with preconceptions about your own abilities - for all you know the teaching method in uni might unlock your hidden potential for math/physics! I've seen it happen before, so don't worry too much and just do your best :)"

HypothesisTesting,1,"Which pillars are you interested in? Knowing that could help us provide a more relevant answer for you.

But in general, we use our laptops pretty much every day. We look at lecture slides online, make use of other platforms to participate in class (eg Learning Catalytics, and now Zoom/MS Teams), take down notes, collaborate with our teammates (eg Google Drive, GitHub), communicate with classmates (eg Telegram, Discord, Outlook), and conduct research. For more technical stuff, it depends on your pillar (and even your projects), though there may be some crossovers in Freshmore (and even some pillar mods). There's writing programs, running simulations, CADding, editing videos, designing posters, and more. These are the more important considerations; at minimum, an ESD student would need a less powerful laptop than an ASD student, for example."
ryanndelion,5,"Hi, an MOE tuition grant basically just means that after you graduate you have to work for 3 years in a singapore registered company.

So if you find a job in singapore after graduation you'll be fine and don't have to pay anything back."
Any-Background-7568,1,Is it worth the money for 3 Terms freshmore?
Spare_Engine1000,1,"Hi. I am also an international student who has been offered admission at SUTD with Tuition Grant. You basically pay a subsidised fee which is around half of the actual fees (29-30K). In exchange for the subsidised fees you work for three years in a Singapore registered Company. You do not have to pay anything back if you complete all 3 years as per the agreement. In the case you wish to break the bond before the 3 year time period, you will have to pay an amount depending on the period of time you have worked in Singapore after graduation (amount decreases the longer you have worked). At least that's what I have heard.

In some cases the Government can allow a student to defer the 3 year work period. The student will have to submit a form asking for bond deferment stating reason (Ex - Pursuing Masters etc.)"

salakuaSG,5,Well there’s a slang in SUTD that ISTD stands for Insanely Self-Taught Department
chickenlord11111,3,Bruh why am j getting upvotes but no comments :(
HypothesisTesting,3,"Hello! I don't think I'm the best person to give any advice here, but since no one else has said anything, maybe I'll give my two cents.

Some background, I'm an ESD senior pursuing the IS minor, with an interest in media and visual stuff. I also have zero idea what biz students study, really, so I will be writing mostly from the SUTD perspective and so it will sound very biased. But I'm not willing to talk about NTU biz when I don't know what NTU biz is, so I hope you can get some opinions from actual NTU biz students too.

You mentioned biz, sociology, comms, design (aesthetic design, and not necessarily design thinking, I presume), archi, and UI/UX. These definitely seem more HASS than engineering, but I think there are avenues to bridge the gap if you remain in SUTD.

In terms of biz, definitely go for the interview and see the outcome (which you did mention). If they accept you, that's one more option on the table, and unfortunately the one option I can't give any advice on because I really don't know what biz students do. If they reject you, you still have SUTD!

In terms of sociology, well I guess you can learn some of it in HASS if you pick the sociology HASSes to satisfy some of your interest in it. Perhaps you could do some sociology mods in NTU too, though I don't know whether you'll have unrestricted electives or whatever they're called there. Not sure if you've tried applying to NUS FASS again, but from the info you've provided in your post, it doesn't seem like this is an available option? If it is an option, that's great! Though I really can't say more than that haha

In terms of comms and design, I guess the good part about SUTD is that even in your pillar projects, you can still pursue some form of comms and design. For example, you could take charge of the posters, videos, and presentation slides in your group projects. (I would suppose the same can be said for NTU biz.) Whether these are suitable for a portfolio to secure a comms/design job, I would lean towards yes, but I don't know how far you can get compared to a comms/design student (or even an NTU biz student? maybe?), at least for your first job. Definitely, a portfolio will help you a lot, and you can try sourcing for your own comms/design internship too!

In terms of ASD, I would defer to ASD students because I can't say I really know what ASD is. At best I can say, I would think there is some element of design that you can pursue, so if you go to ASD, you might be able to pivot and pursue a career in design that is not necessarily archi if that turns out to be not your thing. However, as someone who values their sleep, the backronym ""Always Sleep Deprived"" scares me, especially if I have to pour those hours into something I don't feel too passionate about. ymmv.

In terms of UI/UX,

* ISTD offers [50.006 User Interface Design and Implementation](https://istd.sutd.edu.sg/undergraduate/courses/50006-user-interface-design-and-implementation), a Term 7 elective
* DAI offers [HCI and Design](https://dai.sutd.edu.sg/courses/hci-and-design/), a Term 5 core mod
* If you're in ISTD (or taking ISTD mods), you can offer to take charge of the frontend for other mods' projects too (though whether your groupmates/profs will appreciate it is another story). I would say that it is more of frontend dev than UI/UX, but it's still something you can put in your UI/UX portfolio nonetheless. At this point I also want to mention that ISTD is a lot more than UI/UX, and I don't know how comfortable you are with programming, so do consider that as well.
* If you're in DAI (or taking DAI mods), you might not get as much of a chance to do the same kinds of UI/UX that ISTD allows you do. ([I'm basing this statement on my impression of the courses listed in the DAI course schedule.](https://dai.sutd.edu.sg/education/undergraduate/course-schedule/)) However, depending on the exact project you do, you can still try to squeeze in more UI/UX considerations (since a user interface isn't strictly computer programs and websites, but also the buttons on a microwave and stuff like that), and supplement your UI/UX portfolio. Here, it's also up to you to curate your portfolio to appeal to prospective employers.
* Basically, portfolio is most important. I wouldn't say SUTD is the right school per se, but it is one that can help you build your portfolio, due to the sheer number of projects you'd have to work on. I have no idea whether NTU biz can help you build a UI/UX portfolio, though, so that's still something you need to further research on, if you do get accepted to NTU biz. (But of course, this statement assumes that you'd still want to pursue UI/UX if you go to NTU biz, when you could be pivoting to something else entirely.)

In terms of ESD, actually I think ESD math quite ok leh (I would say EPD math is harder), but this is coming from an average student who doesn't score great in exams, and also isn't doing an ESD focus track (I took two ESD electives, one of which had like no math), so ymmv. There is math I can't do, but it could be attributed to me not paying attention and not the difficulty of the content. Then again, it could also be attributed to the content being difficult and me just not being bothered by it, and therefore not being aware of it. But back to the main point of your post, I'm not sure whether this info is useful for you since you're interested in UI/UX, and ESD is probably not the best pillar for UI/UX. However, there are a few of us who are interested, and are finding ways to build our portfolio anyway, such as by enrolling in 50.006.

In terms of next steps, go for the interview and see the outcome. Also get insights from NTU biz students where you can. List down the factors that are important to you (eg. job prospects, ability to fulfil your interest in sociology, interest/ability in main course content) and assign weights accordingly. Then for each option available to you, assign scores for each factor, multiply by their respective weights, and sum the weighted scores up. Hopefully this can help you make a decision.

Also, I'm wondering, and maybe this can help you decide, what does NTU biz offer that interests you? Maybe what job prospects are there? Like I said, I really don't know shit about biz school, and I'm also wondering where biz school comes into the picture for you.

I admit this has been a very biased post, but I hope this still helps in one way or another!"
huixiang01,13,"EPD junior here. Also pursuing mechanical engineering

1. I am not sure about internationally and locally, maybe a search in Linkedin on where the seniors go might be helpful. But, we got like 90+% employment within the first 6 months. SUTD does have more job being offered than NUS/NTU despite COVID. For EPD, our pay, in general, is around the same as NTU/NUS if you compare apple with apple, say EPD with mechanical engineering. Click here for [SUTD](https://www.moe.gov.sg/-/media/files/post-secondary/ges-2020/web-publication-sutd-ges-2020.pdf), [NTU](https://www.moe.gov.sg/-/media/files/post-secondary/ges-2020/web-publication-ntu-ges-2020.pdf?la=en&hash=E430F2F55D9A8956592E402F4D348CC3FDBC5377), [NUS](https://www.moe.gov.sg/-/media/files/post-secondary/ges-2020/web-publication-nus-ges-2020.pdf). But it is not a case for ISTD, comparing with NUS Computing (if your daughter is somehow interested in computing after experiencing the first year.)
2. It is guaranteed that all students will have at least one internship, cus it is a graduation requirement School does provide a portal to provide the internship. Whether it is a good internship is a different story, and depends on the effort she put in, like if she wants to pursue a good mechanical engineering internship, then she should do more mechanical engineering projects during free time. Joining the fifth rows is one of the few ways to do so. Or do UROP too!
3. hmmm... recognition is still there. Cus like said in point 1, the pay is around the same.
4. Yup, I am a mid-term scholarship holder. Just do take a lookout on the email when there is an opening."
hohouyj,3,"Well basically pretty much every mod in sutd has some level of project work and within each project you would be tasked to find and solve a real-world problem and if not are given a task analogus to one so the application of the design process is typically present in most mods, however this is typically not taught explicitly and different mods have different expectations of how much you should engage with the design process. You also have the Design mod 3.007 in freshmore which covers surprise surprise design."

sprezzaturra,6,"You'll get more and better internship opportunities as a computer science student vs self learning, which would further increase your chances of getting hired. Also, things taught in ISTD such as how to write good code, how computer systems and networks work together are invaluable to any software developer, even if it's just front end. Lastly, you get to meet like-minded people which will definitely help you in your journey."
chickenlord11111,2,"SUTD is partly a design school, does that mean they will teach some design things that can help in UI?"
googleColdMind,2,"I think compared to NUS, the focus on design by sutd makes it a pretty good choice! Many of my friends coming into SUTD are into design and picking up tools like figma for ui/ux became a naturally path. So if u are looking for people with similar aspirations, sutd has those people. You should definitely find seniors with design UI ux experience! there was one working at Disney doing design stuff and shes from istd."
Any-Background-7568,3,"You dont need a degree to be a front end or full stack developer. All you need is a course on udemy. For example Full React.js course, html css bootstrap web design theories. 

ISTD would be a waste of your money because it covers way more than just frontend or ui ux development.

So unless you change your career prospect, any of the degrees offered would be worth it"
henlojseam,1,"Actually, it's better if you studied art first and learned the technical language to express it. ISTD won't teach you frontend stuff, you'll learn it yourself.

A similar course with regards to user interface design found at MIT is taught at SUTD too. This is really all that's taught. You could probably digest all the course content in one sitting lol. 
https://ocw.mit.edu/courses/electrical-engineering-and-computer-science/6-831-user-interface-design-and-implementation-spring-2011/

Frontend development is more craft than qualification. You have to practice and refine the craft. Show your designs to people. Iterate on your own creative process. Build your own design systems. Your signature style is your selling point as a frontend designer."
agreatkid,1,"Hi OP, stumbled onto this post many days late and had to leave a comment after seeing some of the replies on it:

First, let me address a few of the replies on this post. u/Any-Background-7568 mentioned that you ""dont need a degree to be a front end or full stack developer"", which is 1) not very true since a lot of jobs out there will still minimally require a technical degree qualification (less and less true though, which is great!) and 2) not very helpful since this can also be said for some other jobs that ISTD grads can go into such as data science and machine learning (lots of courses and non-degree bootcamps/qualifications for these as well).

Also, u/henlojseam said that ""Frontend development is more craft than qualification"" but I think he is conflating the roles of frontend/UI/UX designer and frontend developer - in VERY small setups, there are people who take up both of these roles but in most other settings, these roles are really served by two different specialists. However, I still agree with him that design skills are very useful to pick up for a frontend developer - at the very least, your developer portfolio can stand out from the boring masses.

Back to your question itself, I honestly can't say that ISTD is a good school to learn specifically about UI/UX/frontend based on the course offerings (only truly 1 course as mentioned by u/henlojseam). I do believe that NUS CS has more of such offerings, and apart from that they also have quite a few courses solely focused on developing software products from the ground up (CS3216 and CS3217) where you can play the role of a UI/UX/frontend specialist on the team.

But just to share a personal anecdote as someone who has graduated from SUTD and is currently doing front-end design and development at a startup, SUTD was the place where I ""found my calling"" (cough cough cliche lol) in this field - I realised my love for graphic design in the freshmore intro to design module, converted that graphic design passion into the field of UI design and development in one of the ISTD core mods (can't remember the name) where we partnered up with some corporate company to create a software product (also where I first learnt and used React.js), then really committed myself to this path afterwards."
henlojseam,4,"It's because they wanna milk students who don't have scholarships since they literally burned most money on attracting faculty and students earlier on. I don't think the education or facilities are significantly better than NUS/NTU, in fact SUTD being a smaller faculty and school it's more constrained.

That being said, it inspired some students to find wealth to escape the rat race. Some alumnus yolo'ed into crypto early on and have enough money to retire upon graduation XD (the surveys don't tell you this)"

ryanndelion,1,It's marketed as like 70/30 I believe? Not sure if it's actually true though.
ryanndelion,28,"My time at SUTD has been defined by broken expectations and great disappointments. The following is a non-exhaustive list of the transgressions SUTD has inflicted upon the sacred academic tradition:

1. I expected to be able to enjoy 3 hour long lectures in a dark hall the size of a football stadium alongside 200+ other students (95% of whom are asleep or playing League on their laptops). Unfortunately, SUTD has smaller, more engaging cohort classes, which makes it too easy to learn concepts. The professors also care too much about educating the students... I want to be forced to self study in order to pass dammit!
2. I expected to be swamped by the loneliness of university life, with no light at the end of the tunnel as I struggled to wake up and go to class every day. Disastrously, the SUTD community is so welcoming and friendly that I couldn't help but take part in social activities and join various fifth rows to enrich myself. I expected to be backstabbed repeatedly by other students climbing the GPA ladder but (to my absolute horror) some of my classmates offered to teach me subjects that I was poor in. Disgusting.
3. I expected to be separated from industry and forced to work on stuff that has no practical purpose, simply because 'that's how uni is, accept it'. Instead I had to do industry attachments??? and internships with interesting projects and measurable outcomes??? wtf???
4. I expected good and cheap food. Unfortunately sutd food is trash.

So yea, just a few points about why my time at SUTD has been such a disappointment. Don't make the same mistake as I did. Be better. Transcend. Ascend. Portend."

But in summary, you can accept NTU offer even after you have accepted SUTD's offer and there would not be any penalty. For the point regarding the subsequent applications, I can't guarantee it but from what I've heard from seniors who applied to universities multiple times (because of national service), they say it doesn't matter and the uni won't ""blacklist"" you, since each application in a different year is taken as a fresh application.

I hope this helps!"
UrFriendKen,5,"It's kind of interesting actually. In the prev acad calendar, EPD took Prob and Stats (P&S) in term 4, ISTD in term 5. However the focus was a little different and so was the syllabus structure. So I can't say for certain if the freshmore syllabus will be similar.

I can only speak from my experiencing the EPD P&S but there is some overlap. I am skipping over the details here. In general, the focus is on different distributions and how they can each be used to model different real world scenarios, as well as all the associated key terms to describe the distributions and probabilities. We also touched on sampling and, by extension, estimators to guess the parameters of the population and how to determine the bias of the estimator used. Combining that given a certain sample mean and standard deviation etc, we learnt to perform hypothesis testing with various error types; Basically methods to determine how likely it is that this sample originate from an assumed population. Knowing that the sample is the ""real"" data, you will hence be able to quantitatively say if the assumed population characteristics claims are supported/rejected by these given samples.

General overview of the course, a lil lengthy. I guess you could spend summer reading up. But also go have fun. I didn't score well on it but didn't score super badly either. It's manageable"

ryanndelion,4,"In my experience most people are able to maintain the scholarship gpa. Even if you screw up for one term, they usually give you some time to improve your gpa. The strategy I've seen some people is to try and push for A/A+ in subjects you know you're good at/very interested in, and aim for approx B in the others. Naturally this is risky business but so long as you do all the hw and projects usually you should be able to scrape by."
galaxyuser,1,Just dropping by to say hiiiiii rocketblasterrrrrr
lkc159,1,"Is it still A=5, B=4, C=3?

If so, a sub-B average isn't difficult to maintain at all. If I recall correctly a majority of my (ESD) cohort had Magnas (4+), and maybe only one or two out of 40 didn't graduate with honours (3.5+)."
UrFriendKen,5,"As you said. 3.007 is over. Don't fret over what you can no longer control and concentrate on your exams. Scoring decently overall is safer than having a single mod pull up your grades.

But if you really want to know, the regular assignments and participation would mostly net you a B (small sample size, biased perception blah blah blah). Anything higher usually depends on the 2D components and overall impression of you project, so subjective? But then again there are rubrics that are followed.

I had a similar discussion/rant with peers and Profs last year. As much as most scholarships only require you to maintain a 3.5 GPA, the presence of this requirement makes you focus more on grades than you should be; Instead of the learning experience and skills gained through projects. 

Personally I am also on scholarship and am scoring decently. But when having to choose between mugging for grades compared to doing a fun and time consuming project for the experience, I'll pick the latter any day."

teeheeee24,3,"Hi! Congrats on the scholarship :)

1) It does not cover hostel fees. The benefits of the scholarship are clearly stated on the relevant web-page on SUTD’s website.

2) I’m still in the second term of my Freshmore year, hence no GPA yet, but from what I’ve heard from seniors, it shouldn’t be too hard to maintain the requirement: 3.5/5.0 GPA which is an average of a B grade, which is thought to be the average grade given out to students. So as long as you don’t perform poorly/ sub-par to the rest of the student population, you should be fine. There are other safety nets as well, which you will find out in the academic briefing at the start of school.

3) I do not believe that that is the norm, although it has happened.

4) Haven’t got the chance to clear this requirement, but some of my peers have by volunteering with Open House preparations. But I don’t think it will impact your studies, 20 hours across 8 terms is not very intensive...

huixiang01,4,"Stereotypically, if you get good grades and fifth rows records, it looks great to applying for programs in sutd, like an overseas program or taking minors.

But if you want to get a job, you must be wanted by the industry, meaning taking up projects that give an indicator that you have a particular set of skills.

But in hindsight, what do you really want? Would you mug all the way and get your first-class honors? Or have a decent grade and have a good life balance?

What is a priority? It is not really determined by the school. In fact, sutd allows you to make your own unique self, or portfolio.

Sutd kinda gives you quite a lot of opportunities. Officially, we got urops, honor programs, fifth-row projects, and whatnot, which is a low starting effort. Unofficially, you can kajiao prof or get from seniors/alumni if you make strong enough connections. Or rather, you will be pushed to make connections, and eventually, get what you want. Haha. In fact, that is what it is like when working outside in the industry.

So ya, maybe discover more, rather than being binded by the education system, as if it is a must-do to-do list curated by someone.

And ya, fifth rows can be competitive, but I don't think you need to be that competitive in order to secure an overseas program (more emphasis on grades)

And for portfolio, it is not whether you have won 1st prize or whatnot, but rather the skills you have in the end. Okay, maybe 1st prize will help HR filter through the first round, but I think what matter more is the interview in the next round"

There are some times you will be burnt out, but with good friends, it is quite bearable"
is_a_act,5,"Most of the projects in the syllabus are group projects, I don’t remember any solo ones to be honest. 

I think part of this cones down to sutd wanting its students to learn how to communicate ideas and negotiate priorities before working in a company.

Yes, shitty groupmates exist. Some just have a bad rep because of miscommunications but some really are in sutd to pass and get some degree. The same’s true for workplaces. Some people just have a bad rep. Some people are just there for their paycheck. You’ll have to learn how to get used to people like that and how you can work with them."

For formulas, try to relate the variables based on their units instead of just memorising the formula. (until you meet dimensionless variables and have your mind blown -.-)

Personally for me, freshmore was an eye opener. I did not study bio for the 7 years leading up to uni. However, the syllabus in SUTD taught me to not memorise memorise memorise like what everyone says bio is all about. I found bio to be challenging but fun, and for things I did not understand I'll consult friends that studied bio in JC.

Courses are mostly well structured with one concept taught each week, with the following week's concepts building on past weeks. Ask as many questions as you can during lessons, be it directly related to the topic currently being taught or otherwise. If you fall behind during lectures and tutorials, consult your profs and teaching assistants (TAs) (Most are quite approachable) and your fellow classmates. You'll be fine. Trust."

rowdyruff_boy,1,"Hey OP thanks for sharing this. If you're fine with it, do you mind sharing your class timetable? I'm pretty curious as to how packed the schedule is. I'm entering the school like next month and I had a long NS break, so I'm pretty nervous haha."

UrFriendKen,1,"Can't say for certain how it is nowadays. Am currently in T5 with my interview being before National Service, so ~4+ yrs years ago. I have more of a mechanical/manufacturing background but was interview by an ISTD Prof. So you may not be assessed by the prof of the pillar you want to get into since it's more of general undergraduate enrollment? It was a 1 on 1. Heard of group interviews but can't confirm.

No idea how that happened, but it seems pretty common I would say. Most impt part is to show your passion for what you are interested in and your ability to work in teams. Think of it as an assessment of how well you would fit into the SUTD curriculum and project based system.

Some technical knowledge is good, but the ability to learn is much more important."

oneminuteprogramming,2,"Hi! I just attended the STEP applicant day last week. It consists of 3 primary activities

1. Ideation/Design workshop (**1hr - 1.5hrs)**  
Essentially an alumni of SUTD STEP conducted this workshop using his new startup initiative called Rolljak ([http://rolljak.me/](http://rolljak.me/)) - its an online social game where people can interact and work on stuff, for example, one activity is an ideation activity where all students are given a   
keyword - i.e. magnet, and have the chance to choose another word, i.e. watch, and you have to draw something that combines magnet and watch together.  Other students can then add on to your design and finally, you can ""invest"" in the best idea.   
This series of events lasted a good 1hr - 1hr 30min
2. Crafting a Pitch (including Prototype/Mockup etc.) **(1.5hrs to 2hrs)**  
After going through multiple rounds of Rolljak games, they would have been done with teaching you various concepts that could be helpful for your pitch.  
For my session, we needed to pitch about education + covid19, i.e. come up with a solution for this.  
We are given around 1.5hrs to 2hrs to come up with slide decks, or work on any prototype (i.e. if you wanted to develop an app, you can use online drag and drop tools to build something simple to prove your point)  
(Not easy I know, but it is what it is lol)
3. Pitching **(1hr)**  
After you're done with your slide deck, everyone will take turn to pitch. They only allow 90s of pitching with 60s of QnA (super short imo)  
But after the end of pitching for each individual, students get to vote for their favourite pitch and that's the end of STEP Applicant Day!

I hope this message is helpful in some way HAHA. Do let me know if you have any more questions!"
amey_wemy,1,"Hello! I've applied in 2020 during the initial covid outbreak. Admissions to STEP did not include the STEP applicant day last year, can't say for the years before.

Any seniors with such experience pls add on!!

However that aside, STEP is a programme to nurture future entrepreneurs. Its generally expected to do pitching and networking, and this applicant day is a great way to expose us to what we should be expecting in the near future. Even if you dislike social interaction, you can treat it as training as to what you'd be doing assuming you take on the entrepreneurship route. 
(I believe there'll be a workshop during the applicant day so they'd be benefits attending it other than just reasons to be admitted)"
asscoolassacucumber,1,hi I applied through SUTD SSA this year and I actually got the confirmation letter in end jan/early Feb. I applied in early jan; not sure if it’s the same case as you. Perhaps SUTD needs more time to review your exam results and portfolio? ATB for the outcome of your application though!
huixiang01,5,"PT 1  & 2. 
Before uni: 2359media, chatbot intern ( 6 months)

After freshie: AEM Holdings, mechanical engineering intern (4 months)

Coming May: Dyson,  product designer intern for air wrap/supersonic (4 months)

Now, the school only officially gives sophomore and above official internship, cus they want a win-win situation (good image of the school) as they feel y1s don't have enough experience for companies out there. Last i heard ( in dialogue with senior management), the freshie went to source themselves unofficially. Frankly speaking, if one got skills and able to be chosen by company, meaning able to source, I think sutd should recognise them as official...

Typically, we intern in summer. That is where all university in Singapore have their summer vacation. Haha. If you choing sua enough, you can take unofficial part time internship, or unoffical winter internship.

* Note: official internships are recognised by the school and then counted as a grad requirement, while unofficial are not.

PT 3.  Around 1k-ish+. The point of internship is experience, not money. In fact, we call them internship allowance, such that if it is an official internship, it is not deductible by CPF. Yes, I heard of people having insane internship allowance, like 10k. That is extreme cases. Their skill level must be dam high.

Btw, if an internship does not pay you, it is a scam ah. If that happens, you must report to MOM. I heard companies doesn't pay cus covid, but it is still your money. Last I heard one of my friends' friend report to school, but school doesn't help her... So yup, straight to MOM.

PT 4. It is a graduation requirement. If you can't find an internship, or companies don't want you, the school will push you to some research internship in one of the automonous universities, and call it internship. With that said, it might not fit your portfolio when you go out and find job.. 

Yes. There are some companies require a certain GPA to get in just for internship. Companies including HP, DSO, DSTA and Dyson.(some require 3.5, some require 4 and above) But, I must say you must be a **correct fit** for the company. That means, the criteria are not just GPA, but also projects and attitude. I suggest you can do the projects you like and study decently well. (A perfect 5 with no portfolio is not a good idea)

PT 5. Like I said, you must be a correct fit. If you have high GPA but you do things that is unrelated to your job scope, no point hiring you. Take for example EPD. If you do so much Computer Engineering stuff like coding and what not, rather than Mechanical Engineering building the skeletons and muscles of the prototype and you apply for a mechanical engineering intern, it does not make sense for companies to choose you. They would rather choose one that is more relevant, proved to be more passionate on what companies do and have the same vision. So, you must prove that you are the correct person for the job.

* Note: how to know whether you are a fit? Usually there will be job requisites when you look up for job description, be it LinkedIn, Glassdoor, company website or school portal. 

Despite sutd being known for its interdisciplinary and its ability to adapt for a different unique skillsets, I must say that there must still have a certain standard of understanding and knowledge for companies to hire you."
is_a_act,3,"ESD alumni here.

1. Interned at Accenture for 4 months.
2. During my summer break between term 5 and 6. (Timetable's different now though)
3. Yes. $1300, including overtime pay. No CPF. It's on the high side, I believe only finance firms and Singtel (research) pays higher. Most people I heard only got $800-900.
4. No, some people graduate with only ALP,  thought I wouldn't recommend that. Some places only accept penultimate year students because first years may not be experienced enough to contribute and it becomes a burden to parcel ""easy"" work for them. When I was a student CDC didn't restrict who I could apply for, though.
5. They gave me a return offer and I'm working happily there now. Looking at CVs of potential interns now, I can tell you having projects and prior experience in internships really helps a lot in making an attractive CV."

Bokchops,6,"CTF sounds like signing on bro. While you may think that you really like something or someone for that matter, your ideas and opinions will very likely change with time. 

I won’t recommend which path to take but lay out some principles and other people’s experiences. 

First off, as mentioned above, your preferences will likely change as you expose yourself more to different things in life. The last thing you want is to sign on to something (be bonded) and then happen to find out that you like doing another thing. Case in point, I had an intern who signed on but found out he had a knack for quant finance. 

Second principle, whatever program you think you’re signing up for, be it the cyber dev thing, the step thing or “data business cyber infrastructure super hot field that will make a lot of money and impress a lot of people” degree program, it will probably disappoint you. It’s the same thing as masters. In the future, when you have friends who did masters in business, finance whatever from Harvard and whatever shit, ask them what they learnt. Common issue everywhere. So the point is, don’t go thinking that some program will make you ready to be an entrepreneur or programmer or whatever. The only thing that can make you that is yourself and luck. Some schools have it better because of community and alumni, but that’s a separate topic. (Which could lead to a whole discussion on inequality in life) 

I think there’re more stuff to talk about. But this thread is getting too long and I need to get back to work. Good luck."
Bokchops,1,Okay. Maybe one last real life point. Cybersecurity in Singapore is generally treated as a cost center. There’s generally an upper limit to your income unless you’re like a sales crowd strike or something. If you’re in it for interest than go for it
Vedallion,1,"I was in the inaugural CyberNSF batch. I can tell you the training isn't easy. Back then I was in SIT and I WANTED to come back camp. Fuck the stay out and the temporary student life. I don't even wanna know what you'll face in NUS.

UrFriendKen,4,"In Freshmore:
1. Python
2. Rhino 3D & Grasshopper (I think, for Computational Thinking for Design)
3. Arduino IDE (Maybe)
- Random applications that I do not know the source of :P (at least for the old freshmore curriculum, mostly for chem/bio. Virtual Chem labs, or smashing flies after simulating mating cycles to study their progeny lol)


For EPD:
1. CAD/CAE. Solidworks Student Engineering Kit Licence provided at SUTD, upon request
2. MATLAB
- Mastercam (if you are into using CNC at fablab for projects, software provided on school computers but just to note. License not provided to students for their personal computers as far as I know)

Not sure what else, but it's mostly up to what your group does for projects based on interest/experience.

You can go with either Mac/Windows as there are always alternatives (fusion 360 instead of solidworks), but if you plan to utilize solidworks without the overhead of running a vm, then windows. Gaming laptops if possible, otherwise prioritise a decent clock speed on cpu. Dedicated graphics is basically a must (RTX20 series/30 series if you can afford it, GTX16 series is generally fine. It will serve you well for cad modelling and computation). Professional work will still be done on a desktop when you grad though.

ROG Zephyrus lineup is good. 
Aftershock is good. 
Alienware is overpriced (and DELL lol).

ryanndelion,19,"Every freshmore is required to have a roommate. That being said, the usual strategies to get the room to yourself include:

1. Use the power of words to convince your roommate to stay at home as much as possible (assuming they are local).
2. Being such a massive dirtbag that no sentient being dares enter your 60-ft wide sphere of influence.
3. Locking your roommate out and placing turrets/traps at the door. Might require skills learnt in 3.007 or certain EPD courses, so you might need time travel to do so before freshmore (see Option 4)
4. Inventing a time machine, traveling to the time when the hostel rules were written and rewriting the rules. Consequences of using this option may include rifts in the space-time continuum, involuntary spaghettification or deleting yourself from existence.
5. Clone yourself, and have your clone apply to SUTD as well. There is a slight chance that you get placed in the same room, thus you will have the room to yourself. Again, option 4 might be helpful to ensure that you and yourself are placed in the same room. 

Do update us on which option you choose!"
rocketblasterpewpew,1,"Hi there! I'm a term 2 freshmore kiddo and I'm currently still staying in hostel, so I'll share my experience here! 

Everyone usually will have to share their room with someone else, but I have classmates / friends that stay in single room.

Before shifting in in term 1, you will have to log onto the housing portal to submit a questionnaire / survey on your lifestyle habits (ie. What time you sleep, what time you wake up, you use fan or aircon, do you like ppl coming into your room or do you extremely value your privacy etc). The school needs this to see how to match you to a suitable roommate. 

You have higher chances of staying in a single room if you sleep super duper late (like 4-5am kind of late), or you can try writing to housing department for a single room due to existing medical conditions.

This is my experience so far; single rooms are still subjected to availability though (we are sharing the hostels with seniors as well so yea)

Hope that helps!"

You can also try to apply for scholarship / financial aid too.

HypothesisTesting,4,"Hello. Well, you guys are the first batch doing the electives in Term 3, so we really have no clue what the electives are like! It would be best to email the faculty at this stage, since they're the ones doing the planning after all.

As for relevance to future pillar, I suppose it really depends on what you want out of university. It would be nice to get more depth in your interest, but it's also nice to learn other things you're interested in too.

You mentioned that you're looking at the DAI pillar, and you also mentioned that you would take another elective over Data Driven World if you're going for something easier to score. Regardless of your choice in interest vs ease of scoring, I would say you have to take Data Driven World. This is because [Data Driven World appears to be a pre-requisite for the DAI Term 4 core module, Algorithms.](https://dai.sutd.edu.sg/courses/algorithms/) If you do not take Data Driven World, I'm not sure whether you will be allowed to proceed to DAI Term 4 just like that. And if you're considering ISTD, the story is the same for the three Term 4 core modules ([1](https://istd.sutd.edu.sg/undergraduate/courses/50001-information-systems-programming)) ([2](https://istd.sutd.edu.sg/undergraduate/courses/50002-computation-structures)) ([3](https://istd.sutd.edu.sg/undergraduate/courses/50004-algorithms)).

And personally, I would say that your GPA isn't all that important in the grand scheme of things, but if you're looking to work in the public sector or perhaps have a scholarship to maintain, then this might not be great advice."
UrFriendKen,4,"For UROP, technically there are no requirements. Both students and faculty can propose projects. For student initiated projects, they will have to find a faculty to be the project supervisor. The faculty will submit the proposal as if it were a faculty proposed project (in essence). After the proposal period, students can log into they school portal to see what projects are available and approach the faculty to find out more and apply through the portal. Typically projects span either 1 or 2 trimesters.


For UROP+, as far as I know (am currently a T5 undergrad), requirement is that you are a Term 6 student. Projects are either proposed by research centres in SUTD or faculty. Application process should be similar to UROP. Projects span 3 terms (Term 6-8) and are independent research projects, having a more rigorous assessment structure compared to UROP with well laid out assessment requirements for a successful UROP+.


No idea with regards to international research.

The pillar you indicated your interest in in your application has no effect on your application; it's just there for Admissions/Marketing/some other office to know what courses are drawing applicants to SUTD. So, based on you and your brother's pillar interest alone, we can't draw any conclusion regarding the application outcome at this point.

It could be that your brother submitted his application earlier, or that there's some differences between your portfolios. Maybe his referee submitted their reference letter earlier. In any case, don't stress! I'm sure SUTD will get back to you in due time. In the meantime, go do other things; there is little point worrying about something you have no control over.

Osami_98,3,"To answer your question, yes. There are a number of midterm scholarship options (SUTD administered and donor) that you can apply under SUTD.  

Applying for SUTD administered scholarships is really quite easy. Its integrated into the admissions portal when you apply. This includes special programmes, donar scholarships, and SUTD administered scholarship (merit,distinguished,etc). In fact, many of these scholarships do not only look at your grades but holistically.

&nbsp;

I do have an issue with how your question was worded though. I am not sure what background you come from (JC or poly), but there are a number of scholarship options in Singapore. If you just collected your A level results, you should have received a booklet on that irrc (its been awhile). Other than SUTD scholarships, there are corporate scholarships (bonded), corporate scholarships (unbonded), needs based scholarships (often provided by various foundations). A simple google search will let you know what options there are and what are things you need to consider.  

Now that you are in the wide world unshackled from the rigid chains of the education system, you need to take charge of your life. Its great that you are aware of the high costs of university education and are worried about applying for scholarships. Now spend some time *(hopefully alot of time since you are aware that applying for scholarships with poor grades isn't easy)* researching how to obtain a scholarship given your situation. Spend time reading the application criterias and asking questions to friends, family, reddit about specific scholarships and ability to secure them. Work on a good resume and seek recommendations from teachers/employers who are able to vouch for your positive qualities outside academic achievements. These are all hard work that you need to put in now that you are in charge of your life.

is_a_act,5,"Yes, you can choose which pillar you want, no questions asked. It's actually an issue ESD has faced in the past because it was such an unusual course that it got disproportionately fewer students though that has balanced out over the years.

The idea that students apply to a major isn't universal, and neither is it universally agreed that applying to a uni to study one thing only is ""better"". SUTD (or its board, or whoever decides on the curriculum) believes that the base provided by the freshmore curriculum enables students to communicate similar concepts. How true that is varies on which student/alumni you ask, but if you ask me, a lot of modules are very relevant."
huixiang01,3,"Yes, you only choose your major after your freshie year. It is for you to discover your passion and what you like. Based on SUTD President in Open House recently, he said 33% changed their decision after experiencing freshie year.   


You are close to 100% guaranteed to choose your own major. I only hear once that one of my friends somehow needs to change major cus CDC screwed his internship? I do not understand the situation. But I think this is a very special case.  


No. SUTD chooses the quality of prospective students in the entrance application to SUTD. SUTD embraces a holistic assessment of the students. SUTD does a survey to plan out the estimated number of students for each pillar, so SUTD has the capacity to hold the different number of students in each cohort.

Ha! I just talked to someone on Reddit asking me this question. The answer is necessary. Take, for example, covid, to make a product for the nasal machine, we need bio knowledge. Or, if you are asked by the boss to lead (cus you have leadership potential) a team that is not your specialty, at least you have the knowledge to lead. In fact, the world is quite interdisciplinary. SUTD doesn't prep you for one specific job, but a wide range (like setting the foundations), and it is for you to customize your own portfolio to find your job."
Osami_98,1,"Yes you get to chose what pillar you want after freshmore, no restrictions at all.  


The reasoning for this is pretty simple. SUTD doesnt create ""specialists"". Listen closely to SUTD's marketing material and other curriculum materials, the term ""technological leaders"" or ""multidisciplinary"" is peppered throughout. There is a reason we don't call ISTD computer science (yet).  
SUTD believes that technology will disrupt conventional engineering domains, and there will be (already is) a need for technological leaders who are more than just good at one deep specialisation(aka major). That is why SUTD insists on a Freshmore curriculum and a Capstone project that involves multiple pillars. These are all elements of the SUTD curriculum that promotes understanding of a large range of topics and technologies, and equips you to be a versatile engineer/architect that is equipped to adapt in the rapidly changing landscape of tomorrow. 

&nbsp;

_SUTD prepares you to be:_  
_An Architect that can code_  
_A Mechanical Engineer that understands electronics systems_  
_A Programmer who understands bio-med technology_  


So join SUTD if you believe in this. Because if you join for a deep specialisation, you will be complaining throughout the whole of freshmore."
HypothesisTesting,2,"I think it is compulsory to have at least one referee. Is there any way you can get hold of your teachers, perhaps through the admin office? I'm sure they'll be willing to help you get in touch! Other than that, is there anyone else you can ask to be your referee? Maybe a supervisor from work (including NS)?"

ryanndelion,2,"malaysian here too, was given full scholarship on admission. I would say focus on what you feel you're best at in your application essays and interview. For me I spent most of my essays talking about my choir achievements (basically showing that I can do more than just study). However you should also show that you can hold your own in terms of academics (a level grades, sat scores, awards etc). Try to find a balance between the two, and if you get admitted without a scholarship, remember that you can always email admissions to ask them if it's possible for any sort of further financial aid application. All the best!"
TurbulentFlounderz,3,"Hi I’m not sure about how the early matriculation helps with catching up as I’m from a different university but my sister plans on applying for early matriculation as well. More details can be found here, https://sutd.edu.sg/Admissions/Undergraduate/Transition-Into-SUTD/Special-Summer-Integrated-Learning-Programme

In the mean time from having gone through university and having just graduated, from my personal experience, I would say to use online resources like Khan academy and such or even go to popular and purchase some JC level summary books for specific subjects to brush up while waiting for your intake.

Not sure about the application status as my sister went through early admissions and they had an interview and an email sent to her to confirm her place. Would suggest you contact admissions if you haven’t received an offer letter. Because if you have a place you should have already accepted your offer.

Goodluck!"
milfmoney42069,1,I don’t think they ask for junior high grades right??

cwkd95,4,"Hi, ISTD class of 2019 grad here. The pillar has some compulsory core modules which teach basic CS stuff like software development, basic computer engineering, algorithms, etc. The more advanced modules are up to the students to select. For the AI track, there are some compulsory modules like machine learning and AI. There are some other modules which teach things like data mining/data visualisation and then there are specialist courses teaching specific fields in AI: computer vision and natural language programming. Just for reference, I took machine learning, computational data science, deep learning, computer vision, natural language processing and artificial intelligence in my 6th, 7th and 8th terms.

I believe the new AI pillar's focus is more on the thinking involved in the design and implementation of AI systems. If you take a look at the programme breakdown you will see there is a greater focus on non-CS related areas. Not sure if they added mobile dev modules but they didn't have those when I was a student. You will likely need to spend time outside to hone your skills in that regardless.

Feel free to DM if you need more info."
amey_wemy,3,"I don't think anyone knows the full ""grading system"" for scholarships however if I'm not wrong, those with lower income are given priority for certain scholarships. (Written in the individual scholarship criteria). But this shouldn't be the case for all scholarships.

Eg. For Shopee - SUTD scholarship financial need is required for eligibility, whereas this isn't the case for Global Distinguished."

Any-Background-7568,1,"Hi guys so SUTD is unique.  When applying to SUTD you don't get to choose what major you want. You only get to choose the major at the end of the ""FRESH MORE"" term which I believe it's like everyone has to sit for the same exact modules.

My question is does that guarantee that you are able to choose the major that you want to study at the end of the term?

Aren't we students applying to a University Major based on our gpa or others? 

Honestly I feel that having to sit for common modules is a waste of time before you actually get to learn your major.

What do you guys think? 

Thank you in advance!"

....btw now that I reached this far, how hard is the interview?"
amey_wemy,5,"iirc ISTD started off being mainly Info Systems but over time, has changed to more of a Comp Sci pillar"
huixiang01,6,"
ISTD(I am an epd dude, so..  a perspective of a fellow sutdent) is more of computer science. In fact, they are changing its name from ISTD to CSD soon. To know more about what you are going to study, you can search up the tracks in that pillar and see whether you are interested in it"
huixiang01,3,"Uhh.. if nothing changes, you s/u your mod at the end of your first year. Maybe just try your best and study? Maybe what you think you did ""badly"" is actually better than the actual worst 2?"
HypothesisTesting,1,"Hello! I think it is a bit hard for anyone here to give a solid answer with respect to grades, as most of us come from the Singapore A Levels or Polytechnic route. However, if your interview and exams went alright, I think you should be good! As for scholarships, it's also difficult for us to say unfortunately. Nonetheless, all the best with your application :)"
huixiang01,-2,"Uhhh... I don't get the question..  if whatever you stated are alright, doesnt that mean that you are quite eligible to get into sutd.

Also, I just assume that you are just talking about non-singapore national exam.

SUTD prefers more on Singaporeans, so there is a handicapped there for international students

For scholarship, sutd judge quite holistically, I guess better grades and outside of curriculum activity? More importantly, question to ask yourself is whether your vision is similar to that of sutd. To find out, maybe look out things that really interests you that is in sutd... Also applies to special programme in sutd too... Whether you are the right fit and material."
huixiang01,1,"There is financial scheme available even for middle income family, and also financial scholarship. For the amount of money given, I really think they are quite appropriate. Just make sure that you apply BEFORE THE DEADLINE. They don't accept late submission. Huge pain if you wasted, let's say, 13 k of tuition fee.

For work, it is time managenent and client management basically. Be discipline in your study and allocate time well, and make them of good quality.

Side job? Maybe you can try 1st term. Cus it is pass fail term and see how it goes."
is_a_act,1,"No experience studying while working, though i did consider giving tuition before because it was the most aligned with what i was doing at the time.

Can consider that."

Thank you"
UrFriendKen,1,"Well if it's SSA, SSA specifically states it is a ""firm offer""; ""regardless of your actual result"".

huixiang01,2,"You could just try it out. SUTD does have entrepreneurship centre and has a start-up culture. Sutd is very interdisciplinary. I guess you just go in there and show what you are as a person and find out how sutd is related to you as a business person or maybe a design person if you consistently draw or solve an engineering problem. In the end, it is up to the interviewer to judge whether you are fit to be part of sutd.."
henlojseam,1,"SUTD is more engineering than artistic design just to clarify. If you are into the artistic stuff go to NAFA instead, or leave Singapore because the scene here sucks. The design is mainly engineering focused compared to something like royal academy.

The design stuff are tied to the engineering modules. So if calculus and math stuff scares you I suggest avoiding SUTD and look for a different course. Architecture students who come here for architecture via poly usually got rekt in the first year. I'm not a shill 😅. If math is second nature the course material wouldn't be too bad. The only design course is introduction to design. 

You will get rekt in the first year if you didn't take A level subjects because most of it is an extension of a level subject materials (Chem, Bio, Physics, Math).  The time frame is pretty short so unless you can learn quickly you'll likely get rekt if you came from poly because the material would be 100% new. It's forgiving in the 1st year as you can use the term breaks to take makeup exams and get a low pass ""C"". Past 1st year you'll need to retake the module in extra terms which will increase the total course fees."

HypothesisTesting,5,"SHARP was not offered for my batch, and I don’t know anyone who applied for it so I can’t say anything about it. However, I would suppose knowing what the problem statement will be about beforehand kinda defeats the entire purpose of the interview.

What I can say is that it seems like an opportunity for the interviewers to understand your thought process, since this is an interview for SHARP as opposed to maybe design thinking. Perhaps it might help to maybe explain concepts to yourself or work out problems in the mirror, which would help you get used to verbalising your thought process. Maybe something like the ways you could approach the problem, and then how you’d select an approach from there. There might not be a right answer, or at least not one that you can feasibly come up with in an interview, so I would suggest being comfortable with thinking aloud.

Or I could be completely off and it could be some kind of Physics question to solve because they want to know your aptitude in academics, idk"

galaxyuser,3,"Hi. I'm a 2020 Freshmore here so I'm in an honoured position to advise you on the new curriculum, that was brought forward from the planned 2022 implementation to 2020 due to the coronavirus pandemic.

**Term 1 (all modules enjoy Pass/Fail status meaning they aren't factored into GPA)**

* **Single Variable Calculus Math (Modelling and Analysis)**
* **Mechanical and Thermodynamic Physics (Physical World)**
* **Rhinoceros Software Archi Design + Python Coding Computing (Computational Thinking for Design)**
* **Humanities (either the economics-based Theorising Self, Society and Culture, or the literature-based World Texts and Interpretations – the economics one is arguably easier than the literature one, so pray you get the literature one in Term 1)**

***Personal Evaluation: The easiest mod by far would be the computing mod, as it's designed to pass everyone regardless (based on my batch's experience). Next would be Humanities (if you get the literature one) as it's comprised only of 3 important assignments and there's plenty of time to complete (we're talking 3 to 4 weeks of lead time). Physics is easier than Math in terms of visualising and conceptualising I'd say, but that's just my viewpoint. Your perspective may differ from mine depending on your academic strength.***

In Terms 2 and 3 collectively, students may choose 2 of 8 modules to be set to Pass/Fail status. In Term 3, students will be able to choose 2 modules from a selection of 4 electives, as part of a pilot programme to give students greater flexibility and freedom of choice to pursue their diverse interests.

**Term 2**

* **Multivariable Calculus and Linear Algebra** **(Modelling Space and Systems)**
* **Electricity, Electromagnetism, Quantum Physics (Technological World)**
* **Chemistry and Biology (Science for a Sustainable World)**
* **Term-long Design (Introduction to Design)**

**Term 3**

* **Humanities (if you got the literature one in Term 1, you'll get the economics one here; vice versa)**
* **Probability and Statistics Math (Modelling Uncertainty)**
* 2 Electives (choose from 4 electives)

&#x200B;

Personally, I cannot advise on Terms 2 and 3 as I've yet to experience for myself the stress and challenges that will come my path going into AY2021. That's all I can share at the moment. Hope this helps somewhat!"
HypothesisTesting,1,"A little late, but I would like to assure you that most people (my prof said about 75%) have not taken Bio in their previous few years of school, and the profs are well aware of that. As such, they have designed the curriculum to build more from the ground up, than from H2 Bio for example. The new chem/bio mod in Term 2 will have a drastically different focus than in previous years, but I'm certain that the profs took/will still take the 75% statistic into consideration."
raymondharrison_,2,Yes. I am indoneisan myself. In fact we have a lot of indonesian direct students here. Feel free to DM my ig for more information @raymond_harrison
is_a_act,3,"Okay, i'm on a laptop now and can give a detailed answer:

Point by point first - workload is not bad, projects to take time, but relative to other pillars, it's not too bad. I had enough free time to work on some personal projects (and use the fab lab for all it's worth).

Curriculum - to explain my thoughts on ""curriculum"", I don't believe any school's curriculum is rigorous enough to give you the tools to succeed in work or further studies. Those tools are more like the ability to learn, understand what to google, who to ask, how to process and digest information from textbooks, etc. I think the systems approach to thinking about things helps in that regard. In an interview the school did with some alumni which I was part of, most of us from ESD expressed that they did not feel that the curriculum lacked much - mostly we expressed that we had taken more ISTD courses, but that's because we were doing programming jobs. An ESD graduate working with mechanical engineers would probably have wished they took more EPD modules. (it just happens that many people go into ESD for ML and AI which tends to lead to dev work). The math problems I did in ESD often ended up turning into logic problems (not in terms of like boolean algebra, but more like: ""what do i know, what do i not know, what actions can i take, how do i discover more, how do i make the best decision from here given some uncertainty, etc). So I'd say i admire the curriculum quite a bit. 

People. My experience will likely be different from you - SUTD was a new school, and new schools draw the adventurous in. There were tons of people who I look up to as role models and learn immensely from, both within and outside of ESD. There were a lot of really good ESD profs while I was there, too, but I understand some have left (""left"".) 

Lecturers. Well. answered that by accident, but the profs are good - some are better one on one, some are better if you know what kinds of questions to ask. I can say for sure that they're all pretty brilliant.

Culture. The faculty staff are VERY collaborative - they constantly talk to students to try figure out what worked, what doesn't, what they can do better and they do apply it. It's very impressive if you ask me and I appreciate it a lot. The small batch size helps in that your voice probably won't go ignored so easily. My batch also worked together to mess with a combinatorial auction (it was a ""bonus points"" thing where an optimisation prof turned some extra points stuff into a game theory situation (side note - game theory is a specific optimisation problem) and the class just wasn't having it so we got everyone to agree on a strategy that gave everyone the max amount of bonus marks)

Similar undergrad programmes - like I said in my other comment - NUS ISE is the closest I've heard of, but ESD does more things. ISE is concerned with things like factory floor layouts - how do you place machinery to reduce walk times and maximise throughput times, or what order of containers do you place things at a port to minimise work time to access a specific container. ESD is less about Industry and more about Systems - e.g. bank queueing systems maybe, or computer systems... The underlying ideas are very similar but I suspect ESD is more focused on system interactions and modelling (and optimisation) while ISE has more focus on specific systems. It is quite a unique course to be frank. I typically tell people I studied applied math.

I'd say ESD was a good choice for me. SUTD's changed since I left, though, but I think the ESD department is good and I benefited a lot from it. Your mileage may vary."
stateofbrave,2,Heard from ESD friends that you will learn some data analytics related stuff. The closest course to ESD is probably NUS's Industrial Engineering.
ZealousidealTrust160,1,esd is my favorite pillar
henlojseam,3,"The workload depends on the courses you'll take almost every course in SUTD has a project and exams. NUS has a wider variety of courses to choose from. I suggest looking through course catalogs of both schools before deciding.

In general, projects may become rabbit holes so you'll want to avoid those. Exams were much easier on time, it takes me about 2 days to finish studying. You could pull a pro gamer move and study during an exam.

NUS being much larger has a wider pool of activities to choose from. SUTD offerings are much more narrow due to its size. Do research on student clubs and activities you would like to be a part of. It's usually a good entrypoint to mix with locals. 

As a rule of thumb, coursework don't really matter most of the time they're not high impact stuff. Spend more of your time traveling and networking. Exchanges are probably the only major holiday you'll have before you start working. If you can skip classes just do it."
anon4anonn,2,"honestly im not too sure abt anything but if u are a female student, do beware if u are choosing nus due to the increasing amt of sexual cases happening in NUS. There has been many peeping toms, and sexual cases happening in NUS. Just do a little research abt it and it will pop up! Do take extra precaution!"
princemoon647,1,what time of year are you planning to go? I'm a canadian computer science student and am planning to go to SUTD for the summer :)
huixiang01,8,"Expect drama. Literally.
- Slackers. People who try to steal credit in the final presentation by wayang-ing and not do any work during the whole term.
- Politics. That is when you choose the wrong people and people do not want to do work and snake around.
- Sleepless nights. The always last min rush when your team realizes you screw up somewhere and somehow.
- Betrayals (like not turning up for meeting at the last min and going on a date with bf after that girl initiate to meet the whole team for work)
- Immaturity (saying others to be confident for the presentation when he is desperate needing confidence, be helpless in all task and spreading all sorts of negativity for weeks, or last min have no confidence to present and tell teammates to present without any knowledge of his work during the presentation after the agreement that he is going to present)

Also, it is all about management and setting client expectations (client meaning prof). If prof happy, you happy. 

One example of a consultation with a prof:

Students: describe the current project and status

Her: hmm... Something is missing but I don't know what is missing

Students: had no idea and blankly stare at her, and ask for some kind of direction.

Her: but something is missing... It does not have the wow factor. If this goes on, you will get a decent grade.

Students: totally have no idea what she wants. And somehow have to accept her comments.

A jolly good ride~ That is only one glimpse of everything experienced in 3.007. but frankly speaking, that is quite close to in the working world so... Yup.

But in hindsight, this mod is a good time to check out everyone as a candidate for the capstone. Their attitude, skills and whatnot.

Also, If you choose your teammates, don't backstab yourselves for not fulfilling the criteria: diversity. Meaning gender, race, pillar preferences, and more(which I kinda forget)

It is not everything bad. Maybe you will find v good friends that will stick with you after freshmore. This is when real bonding happens. There are some teams who buy team t-shirt too. 

This is an experience that you will never get in other universities.

Disclaimer: I saw these situations around me and sharing my experiences, and these are not the things that happened in my group."
9Brkr,8,"I had bootcamp at the end of term 1 for Advanced Math I (not sure what its called now or curriculum change) back in 2018. Its essentially a focussed lesson with 1 or 2 profs teaching the entire syllabus for that mod within 2 weeks for 4 hours a day, every day (except weekends). We'd come in, get our attendance marked at the start and end of the class, and the prof would go through the content with you. The class size was relatively small with less than 20 people, and there was a few TAs assigned as well. Every now and then you'd be on your own to do some practice questions for the topic and the prof would go through after giving you enough time.

At the end of the 2 weeks you'd sit down for a make up exam. I remember it being significantly easier than what came out for finals, but I know some others who struggled with it still. Everyone managed to pass though. I haven't heard of anyone who failed bootcamp. 

If you're down for 2 subjects, you'd have both in the same day, so your schedule would probably be like 8-12, break for an hour lunch, then 1-5. If you're down for more than 2, you'd have to sit for bootcamp for the other subject(s) in the next term break."
ianplowe,4,"There's 3 criteria that they have in assigning hostel rooms, in order of importance:

1. Meet the quota of hostel events attended (During my time it was 3 events every 2 trimesters)

2. If you do not have any non-academic offences (forgot what they are called, breach of conduct or some other 3 letter acronym)

3. Distance you stay from school

Generally, if you full the first 2 criteria you have a very high chance of getting hostel for the next year. But like I said I have already graduated and I'm not sure how the events thing will work during these times, so best to check by emailing the SUTD housing email which can be found on the SUTD website"
amey_wemy,4,"From what I’ve heard, its based on time taken to travel to SUTD."
huixiang01,3,Slightly less than 4 to 6.
WING1123,4,"1. The Freshmore year is compulsory stay in double rooms. So you will have a roommate, who is very likely to be your freshmore classmate
2. It's hard for me to give a board overview as I'm only 1 term into ISTD. As I have experienced so far, some profs are very responsible and passionate, while, sadly, some may not be as much.
3. If the groups are randomly allocated chances are there might be 1 or 2 in my own experiences. But most people are willing to do work and contribute. You would be able to choose your own teammates in pillar years (at least in ISTD). For first year you can choose your own teammates for a 3.007 design mod. That mod is a term-long project."
lohtech,3,"1. Most subjects only require a normal calculator iirc. There is one specific module **Prob and Stats**  in term 5 ISTD (as of 2019) that you will do much better at if your calculator can solve simultaneous equations.
2. Enough for most things. There is no rush to change. It's like buying furniture for a new house. Live in it first and buy based on your accurate needs and wants.
3. Many people know many people in our school. Great diversity of people in terms of skills, characters, personality and quirks. People tend to help each other. I made many good friends here. Overall, it's been fun and memorable."
henlojseam,3,"Hostel stay is mandatory for the first year.

ASD is an architecture course while ISTD is a quasi-computer science course. Both courses are quite different. The first year is a common curriculum of science, math, HASS. You still have time to decide. Architecture studies involve studying other people designs and coming up with your designs and physical models it gets very time consuming. The sustainability bit in S in ASD is kind of an after thought. If you're familiar with software engineering and computer science stuff ISTD isn't too bad. You won't learn theoretical CS stuff like automata theory, discrete maths, in-depth proofs, compiler design in the course. Those are interesting but not generally relevant for software engineering jobs. The faculty is quite small and everyone is mostly working on AI. 

You might probably struggle with physics bio chem stuff as it's not taught in polytechnics unless you took a physics bio chem diploma. If you're good with multivariable calculus and linear algebra math and physics isn't too bad. Optimization and partial differential equations are sort of covered too in the first year. You might want to do some pre-reading as it can go fairly fast if you're not prepared

You don't need revolutionary ideas to pass the course, but you should minimally understand the design process. Herbert Simon's 'The Sciences of the Artificial' is a good read with regards to an introduction to design."
lohtech,2,"**Regarding creativity and innovation**

Creativity and Innovation is always rewarded, especially so in SUTD. But that said, if you don't have great ideas, a lot of these creativity-related projects are team based. 

So here are the silver linings: 

1. Teams don't require too many ideators. Sometimes too many cooks spoil the soup. If you join a team and you don't contribute fresh ideas per se, it could be better. :) Of course, you still need to pull your own weight and share your opinions as and when appropriate. 
2. You don't get penalised heavily for your individual lack of creativity. Most of such work are team-based, (almost all for ISTD)  you can always leverage others who have the ideas. :) 
3. You get to learn from others! Creativity can be learnt as you expose yourself to more ideas. Creation is sometimes imitation :) After all, learning is the purpose of education right?

**Regarding open-book** 

For freshmore, most tests for the math and sciences that require memory work will allow a 1 - 2 sided cheatsheet. This is one of my favourite parts of SUTD education. They are modern and only expect understanding, vs rote memorisation. 

In ISTD, most of the exams also allow cheat sheet. 3 of the exams I have taken are also completely open-book. 2 of them allowed us to search our laptops (no internet of course), 1 of them required us to print our hardcopy notes, as much as we want to bring to the exam. 

**Finally, you asked something about SUTD culture. There are many dimensions of culture (e.g. hostel, exam, project, events etc). If you could elaborate what you want to know specifically maybe we can answer you better :)**"
KiraWang,1,"You'll be using CAD software, likely Rhino. Rhino for Windows has wider plugin support, wider file format support, and support for C/C++ and worksessions. Additionally, you might want to consider that a similarly priced Windows laptop can have a fairly powerful discrete GPU, which will allow you to render faster. I'd recommend the [Aftershock Vapor 15X](https://www.aftershockpc.com/welcome/Productinner/vapor-15x) which comes with a RTX2060, is lightweight, and has a long battery life."

loopy8,7,"SUTD doesn’t offer biology specific majors. The closest equivalent is biomedical engineering, but there is more focus on engineering than on actual biology. If you’re planning to go to medical school you should consider NUS or NTU."
ryanndelion,4,"Hi /u/milfmoney42069 (great username btw), as loopy8 has mentioned, sutd does not have a biology program. That being said, there is a Duke NUS-SUTD special programme where students can do their undergrad in SUTD, then head over to NUS for med school thereafter. The idea is to create tech-focused clinicians. You can find more info here: https://www.sutd.edu.sg/SUTD-Duke-NUS/Programme-Structure

Since you're already at UC Davis you should be familiar with the medical school system in the States, which this program emulates. I suppose the main concern would be whether any of our more tech/engineering focused UG majors are suitable for you. With regards to academic qualification, you should definitely still at least apply to NUS/NTU and if it floats your boat, SUTD-Duke-NUS. I think bringing up your current college and major would be a good boon, regardless of how you perceive your academic standing. All the best! 

(also SUTD does not have a credit transfer system, purely because the stuff we learn in Freshmore year is so different from what is taught elsewhere, or so the marketing team claims. No harm in asking admissions, though.)"
DarkKnyt,3,"You're going to have to get more information in order for people to help you. It totally depends on what field of study you're going into and what kind of software that field of study uses. For example if you're doing something in business and it requires a windows-only piece of software the Macintosh is not going to be great because you're either going to have to dual boot or use a virtual machine. If you're doing data science, sure a laptop might work great, but you could also get an iPad and run Jupyter on it and still have access to almost any data science language that you could use. If you're doing graphic design, same logic that either windows or Mac will work, but you may find yourself using a school workstation because any of the creative graphics software is too demanding for most notebooks."

raphamber,3,"1. You don't get to pick your roommate in fresh more but you can after that
2. Most people go home every weekend. Personally I prefer doing my work in school, so as I started getting more work, I was going home less and less frequently. At some point I was going home once a month. But that's just me haha most people spend their weekends at home. 
3. I cooked once in a while during my freshmore terms. Never went into the kitchen again after year 1 even though I still stayed in the hostel. 
4. Communal toilets on every floor with showers. The showers have hot water. Have heard some horror stories about people shitting on the floor in female toilets. Didn't encounter anything too terrible in the toilets I have used other than the occasional cockroaches.
5. Really easy. Washing machine and dryers on the first floor. Might have to queue for a machine during peak periods (eg. Sunday nights and Friday afternoons). Just avoid peak periods."
galaxyuser,1,"Simple response for you.

1. Nope but you can influence the type of roommate you want to get as there's a survey on your living preferences to better pair two of you up. SUTD Housing definitely has a way of doing a good (but not too great) pairing. Of course there's a chance you do not get the luck of the draw, as with some of my classmates who gripe about their roommate.
2. Very common, unless you choose not to go home. The workload is manageable enough to accommodate fam time on weekends, just have to be super diligent and efficient in your work ethic to avoid slipping behind or en route to failing your important tests, quizzes and assignments.
3. Depends on your classmates and level mates. Some, myself included, can't be bothered to cook, and just rely on canteen food, or SUTD's restaurants, or head out to Changi City Point / Tampines Mall / Tampines1 for some good food (if time permits). But I know of many who have the time to cook at the communal kitchen (found in all 3 hostel blocks, 55, 57, 59, at the first level just opposite the Laundry Room). They've got ovens, actual stoves, basins, vending machines selling snacks, and then lockers to keep your possessions safe.
4. Toilet is cleaned up to 6 times a day on weekdays, and zero times on weekends (from my block's experience). For floor 12 at least, it's 8am 10am 1pm 5pm 7pm. So for other floors, I'd reckon give it a plus minus 45 minutes from the said timings. It's clean for floors occupied with less residents (basically Floor 12), but I cannot say the same for the other floors as there's easily 50 over people using the toilet. Each floor's toilet has 6 toilet bowls, 6 shower cubicles, 4 basins, and no urinals (yep no urinals cause the gender occupying the floors can change with each year).
5. Quite easy. Laundry used to be activated by ezlink tapping. However, the provider has since switched to PayNow QR. It's just a dollar per wash (regardless of washer or dryer machine). There's 8 washers and 8 dryers in each laundry room. As for drying clothes, you can just use the drying cabinet located in your hostel room (it's hidden behind the whiteboard which is actually a door in itself). For larger laundry items like bedsheets, I recommend putting it through the dryer, or hanging at level 12 (but the hanging area is not protected from rain so just keep that in mind)."
TheSpaceSalmon,2,"Not worth it imo, for one only guys will apply as girls don't have much time between A levels and matriculation (not sure if things will change with the new curriculum schedule). Secondly, you don't get additional benefits than if you didn't go through early matric.. overall a waste of time and money really"
keee99,2,"Since no one answeres I can TRY to give one. Im a freshie, PCME, just started school 6 weeks ago, I know quite a few BCME guys in my class. So far, as long as you haven't completely forgotten everything from secondary school, it's hard but probably still manageable in term 1, as long as you attend those help sessions or ask your friends if you're unclear on the concepts. My understanding of why it may seem physics oriented its because ultimately, SUTD is an engineering school, and engineering most of the time needs some sort of basic physics understanding (mechanics, electricity, etc)"
raphamber,1,"My classmates who did not take physics in JC generally had a harder time than those who did. I agree with the other comment above, SUTD is an engineering school so you're going to need to know some physics and your math needs to be decent. That said, there are many people who have gone through SUTD without a physics background."
stateofbrave,2,"1. The bridging course is just a two weeks bootcamp. Covers stuff like kinematics and whatnot. In the first year probably topics like gases, capacitance etc. I guess you don't need to worry because there are people who did not have physics background but still got through year 1. (people like to think that architecture needs physics knowledge but thats the job of civil engineers) What you need to be more concerned about however is programming. SUTD has a heavy focus on using technology to aid design. I got ASD friends who need to use some software that is written in Python and they have coding exams in their ASD pillar years. Maybe also get used to the 3D printer and laser cutter.
2. I can't help with this, I guess try to get one that does not crash? 
3. First year is compulsory to stay in hostel, its kinda fun to live with your classmates in a communal living style. Student life in hostels(even without covid) is pretty much dull after the first year even without hostel, however if you just want a place to stay without having to participate in CCAs then its a good place. 
4. Yes."
zungedous,2,"2. Generally archi softwares work better with PC. So something with a decent graphics card (for rendering and photoshop) and high ram (for multi tasking) is always good. 

Also if you are planning to work in studio often or get hostel, then light weight isn’t really a concern. Better to go with performance instead. Would recommend mid-to-high end gaming laptops depending on your budget since those usually fit the required specs. 

4. While there’s a substantial amount of design work, it’s up to individual to partition their work time and rest time. Archi students tend not to be able to draw that line (myself included) which leads to people eating away all their spare time and sleep just to finish assignments."
Wyntervivaldi,2,"1. Just go along with the flow, I did physics but I was terrible at it and tbh it aint THAT hard

ryanndelion,51,"I have a lot to say about the sleeping-on-campus meta. Here I provide a tier list of locations that is objectively correct. And no, I will not be taking any questions/comments.

**S tier**

* *Cohort Classroom.* There is truly no place like home, and the cohort classes are essentially your home away from hostel away from home. With a cheap knockoff mattress from taobao, you and your fellow tired classmates will be conquering dreamland in no time. I recommend using the mini think tank, especially if you plan to take a nap before class - don't want the prof walking into your snoring ass on the front row tables!
* *Root Cove*. The Root cove is known to be one of the most comfortable sleeping spots on campus, unless there are people having meetings or playing board games in there. Even in those cases, the second level is generally very quiet. Unfortunately not open for now, but good to keep this as a pocket pick once the new balance patch rolls in.
* *Library*. This is technically in building 1 so it's not cheating to pick this option. Aircon from 9-5, plenty of cubby holes with conveniently plush cushions, and the constant looming threat of *knowledge* surrounding you. What's not to like? A very common but justifiably powerful pick in this current meta.

**A tier**

* *Lecture theaters*. Yet another super comfortable option (assuming aircon is on), but one runs the risk of dozing off right before a class begins, resulting in a desperate attempt to either pretend to be part of the class, or sneak out whilst still half asleep. Risky pick, but worth it if you work on your mechanics.
* *Special Rooms*. As others have stated, other rooms such as STEP room, DDP room, Think Tanks and various fifth row specific labs are usually good places to catch some sleep. The reason these airconditioned and comfortable rooms are not S tier is because of the exclusivity - you often have to be part of that group in order to gain access. If you're a strategist and a forward-thinker, submitting an application to STEP or other special programmes is a good way to get ahead in the sleeping meta before all the other plebs steal away your precious picks.
* *DBS bank*. Super underrated spot imo. It's a bit out of the way, but there are cushions and a flat surface provided, so what's not to like? Also, you can use the resting time to reflect upon your financial situation - a surefire way to improve your standing in future metas.

**B tier**

* *Toilets*. Some might be confused at why this is so high up. But but toilets are so dirty!!1!1!, you cry. No, my child. You have to choose the right toilets. Generally the disabled toilets have a lot more legroom, so if you find a freshly cleaned one it can often be useful in a pinch. Again, not recommended unless you're desperate but hey, if it works it works.

* *Benches*. General term for any benches in the buildings. Some of the more common ones are in the walkway to canteen on B2L2. Is it a coincidence that these benches as long as the average person is tall? I think not. The main issue with sleeping on these benches is that you're basically sleeping in public. Also, it's just a block of wood. Nonetheless, it's a surprisingly common off-meta pick, especially for non-freshmores without access to cohort classrooms.

**-----------Tier Break-------------**

**F tier**

* *The floor/Corridors*. Often very disgusting and dirty. Don't sleep on the floors unless you're certified insane. Also, you are going to be hard countered by skateboarders and scooter riders. Don't do it.
* *Bicycle parking lot*. This one is a bit of a meme pick, but if you want to look like a hobo, feel free to sleep there. Main issues are a) looking like a hobo and b) exposure to large amounts of cigarette smoke. Parking lot is never going to be meta, so don't bother picking it up. It's for your own good."
huixiang01,4,"I assume you are a freshie.hahaha. but really, better don't make this happen again in term 2.

Root cove? I don't know whether it is open.

Your class mini think tank? My class (last year) brought sleeping bag plus constructed a sleeping tent(from design mod). My next door class built a legit bed. I don't know whether they allow you into the mini think tank. 

Special rooms.

Fifth rows rooms such as

canceler80,8,"Learning programming languages is like picking up a musical instrument. Once you know the concept of one, it’s not difficult to read documentation and pick up new languages as you go.

Once you know the basics of algorithm through Python as a medium, the same basics are applied in C, Java, Matlab, VBA etc. Syntax and semantics are the only differences. 

Also, ISTD is math. Programming languages is just the tool, like the brushes that a painter use. The knowledge of what “colour”to use, what “technique”, is beyond programming. For ISTD, what drives our knowledge is Linear Algebra, Statistics, MATH. Not programming. 

Which is why after graduation i went to become ATC. Cant handle the math"
stateofbrave,2,"Coding languages shouldn't be your main concern. What you should be concerned about is which area of tech you want to go into. Do you want to do frontend? Then start learning things like Javascript, HTML and CSS, and maybe pick up a framework like React.

In term 4 and 5, you learn the basic things that trains you to think like a programmer. In term 4 that would be things like algorithms and computer structures. There would also something like a Java introductory module but you learn OOP concepts, and you also have a project where you do Android app development. 

In term 5 you learn software engineering principles and more computer structures, and also stats (which helps if you want to get into AI/ML)"
zungedous,2,"1. Depends on which term you are doing. The second year and last year terms are generally more hectic due to a good number of compulsory courses. Studio hours depends on your prof/tutor, but they're generally in the afternoon on Mon and Thu.  
Do note that in SUTD, you need to undergo one year of general education before being 'streamed' to ASD. However, the syllabus is changing and I heard they're incorporating an ASD related course in freshmore this term so hopefully that helps makes it easier to get through the first year.  

2. You're referring to technical drawings with pen/pencil?   
Generally, you'll learn the same techniques from the earlier classes that teach the drafting software but there's no formal class for learning hand-drawing. Some tutors might teach some techniques during studio.   

3. I know a couple of friends who went to Zhejiang Uni since SUTD is partnered with them. Not sure about other overseas unis though, but...uh well....pandemic...zzz  

4. I think SUTD ASD prepares graduates more for academic/research life rather than practice/industry. There's more emphasis on technology and softwares that architects will use in the future so I find that grads might be jaded when working in an industry that might not see immediate use of their skills.   
But of course, I know of friends who do excel as a practicing architect so I would say it's up to one's personality and working style."
try_harder_later,3,"Well, they just revised the syllabus, but since they probably didn't change too much from last year...

It's similar topics to JC math, physics and a little bit of bio and chem. The physics and math in particular is more dense and is building up to what the pillar years need.

There's also a basic programming mod (python 101 basically) and a design mod.

Look out for the 2D projects where they integrate topics from 2 diff mods, such as physics and math (do physics experiment, make math model, test prediction)."
galaxyuser,3,"Term 1 is literal cancerfest (saying this as a 2020 Freshmore).

positron559,7,"The current ryzen based laptops such as lenovo thinkpads or Hp envy are really good and should be enough for your whole education in sutd. 

Dedicated gpu are only be required if you are doing high workloads on CAD programs with a load of part files or doing alot of renderings which are normally for ASD/EPD. Other than those 2 pillars, any recent laptop will do fine. Even adobe and light CAD will run fine with integrated graphics.

In terms of macbooks, I would reccomend getting one now before arm due it being a different architecture so software compatibility and reliability might be an issue with arm.

I personally use a 13 inch macbook pro 2020 and I have no issues with it running fushion360 and adobe premier pro. Of course, that includes that I don't do CAD with hundreds of parts under professional capacity or edit 4k videos that require multiple rendering. 

A few things to note when buying your laptop. Firstly, you will be carrying your laptop around so laptops with high end GPUs tend to be heavier and the battery life is pretty bad. Secondly, it also depends on what OS you like. Do note that IOS/mac apps can only be developed using a mac based device so if you are interested in that, a macbook works. Thirdly, is the warranty service center good and easy to access in Singapore?

For my recommendation, I recommend any recent laptop with 10th gen intel for the boost in integrated graphics that might come in handy but 8th gen is still good too. Ryzen based cpu are popular now and it would work too although I have no experience with ryzen cpus.
For the memory, 16gb ram would be best if not 8gb will work fine but you can't multitask as much or open more browser tabs.
For storage, 256gb is pushing it so 512gb would be the sweet spot as it normally comes out of the box with about 490gb so after installing your apps, you would have around at least 400gb to play with which is more than enough to me.
I would say only get dedicated gpu if you fall into any one of these categories:
1. You want to game.
2. Planning on going to EPD or ASD.

U can drop me a PM if you wanna ask more in-depth or what not.

Edit: Forgot to mention that dedicated gpu is also a bonus if you are doing machine learning stuff but most of the time, people run machine learning stuff on the cloud such as google collab which is free or servers that can be rented fairly cheaply."
9Brkr,3,"Not a recommendation from me, but if you're interested in getting a Mac for school, you might want to try Apple's education offers here:

WING1123,1,Year 1 there’s one intro programming course which is simple enough that I think 8gb would be enough. You might need abode/CAD for your design mod (previously it’s 3.007 but I’m not sure about the new name) and that’s could be heavy.
try_harder_later,1,"The surface go will be enough for the first year, though you might want to leave the CADding to your teammates. Intro to programming is fairly lightweight tbh.

huixiang01,3,"By right you should write an email to the prof about the urop to find out more about the urop and also to get to know about the prof. If you accept the urop, it is commitment that you are going to put like every week. Without knowing what exactly that you are up for, you may miss another UROP opportunity during that same term. I think prof here will be willing to set up a zoom call for a get to know session. If the prof is not even willing to set up, maybe he is looking for sophomore and above for the research.

So, I guess you should write an email now, not just to find out the results of your application but also to get to know about the project and the prof.

If you have already talk to the prof, you kinda get a sense whether he wants you. Just prompt him a bit to accept if you want.

For the straight to the prof, if the prof agrees to let you do research, it is possible. If you want to get the cert for that research, I don't know whether student admin will allow"

* ""if planning to do any machine learning (ML) stuff, a windows laptop with RTX2060 or above is better if budget allows. macs have weaker gpu, can do ML stuff is can. if the plan is to do other development other than ML, mac would be good/better.""

ryanndelion,19,"Hi techuku, food at SUTD is an affront to humanity itself. I'm joking of course (or am I?). The food isn't the best (some might say it's the worst) but there are some decent options around. 

Canteen food is generally affordable. Some stalls are better than others. I leave the precise determination of this ranking as an exercise for the reader. The indian stall is good and sells vegetarian options as well. Some other stalls in canteen also offer vegetarian options (but no guarantee that it's strictly vegetarian, you might get lil pieces of meat in your vege for example). You can get a decent meal including drinks for around 4-6 dollars in canteen.

Outside of canteen, the perennially underrated Gom Gom sells vegetarian sandwiches, and both D'star and My Nonna's offer vegetarian options as well. These are pricier than canteen food (5-10 dollars).

Finally if you're feeling adventurous there are indian/vegetarian food outlets near campus (namely in changi business park, UE Bizhub East and Changi City Point). I personally love Ananda Bhavan which is purely vegetarian South indian cuisine and holy crap is it good. A bit pricey (around 10 bucks for a lunch set) but it's worth it every once in a while.

Additionally, I think students who have opted to take a HASS minor will be able to select their HASS modules a week before everyone else (in order to ensure that they will qualify for the minor), but this is taken from a convo with a friend last term, and may not be 100% accurate in future."

HypothesisTesting,5,"Hello! I have yet to take any modules for the minor I intend to take (will be in Term 6 next term), but I would like to refute points 1 and 3.

**Taking a minor does not necessarily mean overloading your term.** It depends on the pillar you're in, and the minor you choose to embark on. For instance, **for HASS minors, you do not have to overload at all**, as you just need to select all your HASS mods in your pillar terms from the set of the HASS mods recognised for the minor. **For non-HASS minors, there is some variability.** In my case, I am an ESD Junior who plans to take the IS minor. I do not intend to take a Focus Track, so I do not have to overload in order to fulfil requirements for both a Focus Track and the IS minor. Previously, I had settled on the Supply Chain track + IS minor, and for that, I did not have to overload either, as I had intended to take Statistical and Machine Learning, which counts towards both Supply Chain and IS minor. This would be the same case for the Business Analytics and Operations Research Focus Track + IS minor. However, any other ESD Focus Track + IS minor, and there would be a need to overload. I am not sure of other combinations and whether they require overloading, but the concept is the same.

**Taking a minor does not necessarily mean that your GPA will drop.** It depends on the minor you take, as well as how well you do in the modules that constitute your minor. Taking a minor essentially means that you're taking a (subset of a) specific set of modules, which is the same concept as a Focus Track. **Whether your GPA will drop would depend on how well you do in those modules, which is the same for pretty much any module you take, minor or not. Whether that minor specifically will cause your GPA to drop will depend on your performance in those particular modules, compared to the other modules you're taking.** Perhaps you may have more aptitude for those modules, so your GPA may go up. Or maybe it's not your strength, so your GPA may go down.

However, considering that one may have to overload in order to fulfil one's minor requirements, there is a chance that that has some relationship with a lower GPA. This is as one may find themselves strapped for time, thus having to sacrifice some components here and there, overall possibly resulting in a lower GPA (if the math works out that way). Whether this is a relationship present in the whole student population, however, I don't know. We do not have the data nor the statistics, but it would be an interesting hypothesis to test."

HypothesisTesting,6,"I believe spillingcofveve has answered your question regarding internships well enough, so I will answer your question on exchanges. Disclaimer: I have not gone on exchange, but I have attended a few briefings and have a rough idea. Perhaps others may be able to chime in with their experiences!

There are two types of overseas exchanges available: credit-bearing exchanges and non-credit-bearing exchanges.

Credit-bearing exchanges usually take up a full term, and according to [the new academic calendar](https://www.sutd.edu.sg/academic-calendar), you may embark on such an exchange in Term 6, or the vacation term before that (ie. after Term 5). (I believe this means more opportunities to go for exchange for the batch matriculating in AY2020 onwards, but this is just my guess.) This exchange is currently known as the Global Exchange Programme (GEXP). The current process, according to the GEXP booklet, is as follows:

1. **Pre-Application & Research**  
This is the part where you do your research to determine if the modules offered by the Host Universities you're considering can be mapped back to your pillar's mods (and possibly focus tracks), thus allowing for credit transfer. These credits count towards your SUTD degree, but not towards your CGPA.
2. **Online Application**  
Apply for Exchange via MyPortal.
3. **Selection and Interview**  
Shortlisted applicants will be interviewed by the global exchange office.
4. **Complete Study Plan**  
I believe you will complete some forms to declare what modules you intend to/will offer. Not too sure about this one, because the period for this overlaps with the next three steps, but you will definitely have to let SUTD know what mods you take.
5. **Acceptance by Host University**  
If you have been selected by the global exchange office, you will have to accept or reject the offer (note that you will only be offered one of your choices). If you accept, the global exchange office will then nominate your name to the relevant Host University. You will have to submit additional documents for the application, but the exact details will be different for each Host University. Only after the Host University has officially accepted you, will GEXP be confirmed.
6. **Pre-Departure**  
Briefings and admin matters.
7. **Start of Exchange Journey**
8. **End of Exchange Journey**
9. **Complete Deliverables**

In addition to GEXP, there are also some credit-bearing Summer Programmes, such as those offered by Stanford and Berkeley. I do not know as much about them, but according to friends who have gone for them, you may take only one credit-bearing module (as opposed to four in GEXP).

On the other hand, non-credit-bearing exchanges, well, do not allow for credit transfer. However, you will be able to take classes of some sort, depending on the exact exchange (there are quite a few!). The duration of the exchange also varies a lot more (could be two weeks, could be two months). It is also possible to embark on exchanges not advertised by the global exchange office. I'm not sure of the application process for these exchanges.

Just save your notes on OneDrive for easy access. Besides, it is good to connect all your devices together(iPad, laptop, sharing with others, etc.)

Special software? I don't know about the new revamped term since you are the first batch. If you are in fifth rows, you would probably need a powerful laptop, like downloading solidworks for cadding or premiere pro to edit videos, due to the lag and the storage size respectively. 

If you want to code, just use cloud.

HypothesisTesting,4,"Since the introductory programming module has been moved to the first term, I would *guess* that you would be asked to install Anaconda within the first week of class.

Additionally, the set-up should not be too troublesome, so if you need help setting it up once you get your new laptop, you can always ask your instructors/classmates/TAs!

However, there has been changes to the module (now known as [Computational Thinking for Design](https://smt.sutd.edu.sg/education/undergraduate/courses/computational-thinking-for-design)), and it now includes ""visual programming"" on top of Python programming. Without further knowledge of the syllabus, I cannot tell if this visual programming (which I have 0 idea of what it entails) will come first, or if Python will come first, or both will be taught simultaneously, and hence am not sure if you will have to install Anaconda and/or whatever will be used for visual programming in the first 2-3 weeks.

Furthermore, with changes to the rest of the Freshmore modules, I am also not certain whether you would be asked to install other pieces of software, but my guess is that there won't be any need to do so in the first 2-3 weeks haha"

tlling30,1,Thx senpai
Intelligent_Fox8275,1,"Hihi! But the tuition fees covered is capped at the amount paid for Singaporean, so does it mean u have to pay out the difference from ur own pocket?"
ryanndelion,11,"It sounds like you already know why you chose SUTD, so that's good. The main concern most students (particularly those from singaporean education background) have coming into SUTD is the perceived lack of academic rigor. And of course the lack of 'pedigree', as if that means anything anymore. 

Unfortunately, I have to agree that to some extent, SUTD's curriculum eschews depth in a specific subject and focuses more on a wide breadth of knowledge. If you intend to go into industry after you graduate, this is actually quite beneficial, since most of what you'll be using in the real world will be picked up on the job anyway. What matters most is your ability to learn fast and I think SUTD trains us to do that effectively. That being said, I must admit that at times I was frustrated that some of what we learn is quite surface level, but you can easily alleviate that by talking to your profs, getting access to textbooks and self studying. The undergrad research programs help in that regard too.

In terms SUTD's relative youth compared to some of the other unis, I think that actually makes us more willing to push for weird and wonderful ideas/projects. When I first came to sutd the culture of 'if there's a problem, just design something to fix it' really impressed me, and even after visiting other universities in SG and China this culture remains unique. The people are super friendly, the profs (generally) treat you as equals, and in general the community feels like a big dumb family. 

So yeah, don't be worried about negative perceptions about your choices. Focus on what you (i.e. the flesh golem your spirit is piloting) need and want for your education and uni experience. If you prefer diving deep into quantum physics, then SUTD isn't right for you. If you want to pick up a bunch of useful skills and learn how to learn, then it might be right for you. But hey, at the end of the day you'll probably be fine either way (statistically speaking). Just make sure you enjoy the ride."
zackteo,1,"Community is great, I have made the most number of genuine close friends from my time in SUTD.

But yeah, I enjoy and appreciate it very much that everywhere I turn I'll encounter friends, is nice to see their presence even when we are each rushing stuff.

I guess, there's times when things can be frustrating... especially when the school does things to make SUTD more conventional (as the Singapore mindset inadvertently comes into play) and marketing stuff too.

But amidst all that, now that I'm left with a year, I already feel I'm gonna miss this all :x"

Exchanges are also like the same. It is like demand and supply. If a lot of people want to go, then it is high. Overall, if you get a decent grade and community participation in SUTD, it should be okay. 

just want to say that anyone should not rely solely on uni to find jobs/internships for you. Get some connections out there, talk to more peeps, and upskill yourself."

zungedous,3,"Not gonna lie, but ASD can be quite tiring especially closer to submissions. You need to manage your time very well since design work is a never-ending process and it's possible to burnout by just constantly changing till the very last moment. 

Personally I didn't work while studying, but I do believe is possible if you have good time management...same applies to social life too. 

If you don't mind academia jobs and have decent grades, it's possible to take on part time teaching assistant (TA) and research assistant (RA) jobs which are offered by the university or profs. I had some friends who taught part time tuition (like math, sciences) but it's up to what you want to do. I can imagine F&B being really taxing and you'll need to free up your work schedule a few weeks before major design/project submissions as that is the major crunch time for ASD. 

iPad definitely helps, but I got through my bachelor and masters without one...sticking to traditional pen-and-paper lol. I got mine from the Jewel apple store with student discount (pre-covid) and it has been working well as both a notebook and sketchpad till now."

zungedous,7,"ASD's syllabus is a bit different from the traditional archi school since there is some level of programming involved in some of the early courses. But I know some of my friends/juniors can get through without being good at it. On the other hand, I find that drawing skills will improve over time, since it's the most effective way at conveying ideas. 

SUTD with ASD masters is 4.5 yrs, slightly faster than NUS archi with masters (5 yrs) iirc. Usually most people choose to take masters since its required for the professional licensing exam if you want to be a practicing architect in singapore after you grad. However, I do know of friends who gave up on being architects after the bachelor course and still doing okay in life, so it's really a choice on what you want to do after that. 

To be honest, i don't think anyone can say whether you're suitable for archi or not. If your passion is designing and making things, then you'll be able to pull through. It did help me pick up a lot of useful skills, both in software, coding, critical thinking and 'soft' design skills...a combination which is not as common in most other fields of study.  Most of these skills will be useful outside of architecture, which helps you to branch out into other career paths in the future. 

Good luck!"

ryanndelion,5,"Uni is very different from JC/sec school cos you are expected to self study a lot. Make sure you make time to understand the concepts learnt in class bcos slides are often insufficient. 

Personally I always read the textbooks first, especially for more math based courses - they tend to provide a lot of intuition. If you have specific questions it's best to ask your peers or prof (most will be happy to have office hours online). Also take notes during lectures! Profs often mention ideas and concepts that aren't presented in the slides."
cavalier96,5,"3 methods I used to get by:

1. Scale the amount of time you spend on each subject depending on how much you need it. If you're struggling with academics it's advisable to set yourself time for constant reviewing of content e.g. spend 15mins after dinner skimming through slides for the day to figure out what you
2. For some courses it can be helpful to adopt a question-answer-example based note-taking system. At the start of each lecture the Prof usually puts up learning objectives. What I liked to do was to copy each objective at the top of each page of my notes then take down elements in the lectures that specifically answered/pertained to these questions/objectives. Profs usually set slides based on what they want you to learn, so being able the answer the learning objectives will at the very least give you a basic understanding of the content that was covered for that day
3. Don't be ashamed/lazy to ask for help. Whether it be attending help sessions with TAs and Profs or asking your friends who understood the content for help, setting aside time to do these things goes a long way in trying to understand the content.

All the best!"
is_a_act,2,"I think the things that I would've liked to hear are:

1. don't be afraid to ask questions. Profs and TAs mostly are helpful, and some profs that are bad at teaching to a class are amazing teaching one on one.
2. understanding what you're learning is SUPER important if you want to do well, try to get the feeling for what is right and what isn't.
3. pay attention to office hours and use them when you don't understand something."

p1nkp3ngu1n,2,"UWaterloo has the best uni subreddit and is the true MIT of the North.

Imo the Cs kids/profs from there are darn hardworking and talented."
is_a_act,1,I can't answer most of your questions but I know ISTD graduates get jobs pretty easily.
lohtech,5,"Yes. At the end of term 2, there will be interviews. I believe Stanford and UC Berkeley have always been up for grabs. 

The people who have scholarship would have secured slots, but I think there are still significant slots for the rest.

Awarded based on merit such as CCA, leadership, academics, character, attitude, essay and interview performance."
virulentxxx,1,i went on GLP! ask me anything
cavalier96,3,"Internship opportunities are of a decent range from what I can tell. Generally the Profs and some of the Seniors will have advice and recommendations for you too if you can't find them. Granted it's a tough period now, but in general I've found looking for internships to be an okay experience.

For more technical roles, companies tend to prefer more technical portfolios so academic projects and personal/research projects in the form of club stuff or UROPs will go a long way in helping you secure them.

Exchange programs/student study trips happen around the year. For 1st year students I believe there's DATE among some others which I'm not too sure about at this point. Some clubs also organise overseas trips and there's a big period in Term 6 where the full-term overseas exchange happens (note some of these dates may have changed with the shift in curriculum structure, so they exist but just happen at different times and you might need to look them up for more specific information). The marketing is such that everyone gets the ""opportunity"" but imo it's misleading if you're kind about it, false marketing if you're being blunt. Exchange like many opportunities will depend on GPA, but your 5th Row performance and other contributions to the school are assessed as well."
is_a_act,1,"haha i've just replied to your comment elsewhere re your first question so on you second question - it depends a lot of which club you're looking at. I was in photography, where things are chill (when i left). some of the sports clubs are more intense - but that's understandable since they're at competitive level. It varies a lot depending on what you're interested in. maybe telling us more about yourself would help us answer your questions, too?"

pauldestiny98,3,"In my opinion it is soo vibrant. Why expect vibrancy? Why not be the vibrancy? We hear NUS/NTU being vibrant and all but ultimately we create our own definition of fun. Nerding out at 1am in the morning with my classmates being one of them. Learning new recipes. Meal preps. Running from security guards oops. Hall life is all about stepping out of your comfort zone and making friends we can trust. If you wanna hide in your room and expect vibrancy to be knocking on your door then be prepared to have a boring life. Get out there, talk to people and do things tgt. Tbh the gym and the swimming pool is ma fav go to place, check them out."
lohtech,2,"1. Hall life is admittedly not as vibrant as NUS / NTU. We have House Guardians (HG) for each floor who will occasionally organise mini events for the floor like prata party or pizza party. Hostel also has hostel wide events, but those aren’t usually very fun. We usually participate to get participation points - which helps to secure your hostel placing. 

During freshmore, usually students will be more bonded. From my time, the freshmore classes all live next to each other and always organise spontaneous events like supper or cooking sessions. 

2. Clubs and activities - totally depends. There are some clubs that meet 3-4 times a week and even more nearing competition or any type of showcase events.

There are some that are much more lax. We have a good range basically. Better to ask the club reps to find out more."
HypothesisTesting,1,"Hi, I'm an ESD Junior, so I've completed two terms in ESD!

Content-wise, the core idea of ESD is really analysing and optimising (and designing). It's about figuring out the best (or a reasonably good) solution to a problem, using the data you have at your disposal. Various math models, tools, and software are employed to help with this, such as Parallel Coordinates, QGIS, and nimbus. The R programming language is also used quite a bit, in my experience so far. The design element is, at least in my opinion, getting things organised and done systematically, identifying relationships between subsystems, and hence being in a better position to then begin tackling the problem.

The day-to-day work we do is mostly math (or math-based, not too sure) and some programming. Without a proper survey, I am unwilling to gauge what the average sentiments of the modules are. ESD is sometimes jokingly referred to as the 'Extra Sleep Department', but this definitely does not hold true throughout the term, and there are people who will protest the nickname!

Additionally, I have not been through terms 6 to 8, so my opinion is not fully reflective of the entirety of ESD, and it would be good if a senior like u/ryanndelion could weigh in :)

Also, you may want to note that with the change in Freshmore curriculum for this year's intake onwards, Probability and Statistics will be taught in Freshmore instead, so there will definitely be some changes to the ESD core. As of now, [it appears that the ESD pillar is planning to launch a brand new ESD core module called Engineering the Smart City: From Sensor Network Design to Big Data Analytics](https://www.sutd.edu.sg/About-Us/SUTD-Growth-Plan) (under the Cities section), but I do not know further.

I think my student life was pretty good until DORSCON Orange hit. I had two Fifth Rows up til Term 2, and then dropped one to focus on the other from then on, and I'm still enjoying it. Halls, well definitely not as happening as other bigger universities, but it's pretty okay. There are hostel-wide and floor-wide events and activities, though the latter greatly depends on your floor's House Guardian. Though, in Freshmore (assuming we can go back to campus and stay in hostel), since you and your classmates will mostly be housed within the same few floors, you could have room parties, play board games or video games, stay up late to do projects, or even head back to your cohort classroom for a karaoke session. Overall, your student life is really up to you, how much you wish to commit and all!"
is_a_act,1,"ESD alumni here

When people ask me what it's like i tell them it's applied math. There's a lot of interesting stuff, optimisation was one of my fav classes because it needed a lot of lateral thinking.

There was another summary of ESD which was ""Model, analyse, optimise"" and to break that down - modelling would be to represent something in the real world in a way that *allows* you to ""act"" on it - e.g. ask questions about it, like ""what would happen to queueing times if double the people arrived within 1h""? Analysing would be doing the calculations to *answer* the question the model enables you to ask. And Optimising would be to figure out what you can change to minimise waiting times. 

So imagine that, but there's lots of systems. Cargo containers in a port, how to fold origami such that volume of a cuboid is maximised with as little paper as possible, anomaly detection in a wireless network, stock trading, etc. So that's how i'd explain ESD. Problem solving for many different types of problems.

RE: student life, I had a fun time, but I felt that student life was more limited to your circles of friends. It's not easy to break into new circles unless you have mutual friends, but the cohort isn't too big and usually someone knows someone who knows someone. 

I hate the idea of hall life, don't get me started. Just let me sleep, don't try to get me to socialise, ugh.

Many of the clubs are more like... mailing lists. That's for the makers anyway. They're spread quite thin, though, since there's so many, and so few students. The sports and arts clubs are a bit better at regular meetings and trying to enforce stuff, but I wasn't active in many of them."
HypothesisTesting,7,"Hello! It will differ from mod to mod, and prof to prof.

Generally, profs will make their lecture slides available online, usually on eDimension (the learning management system). Usually the slides (the student version, aka no answers) will be made available before the class so you can take a look at them before going for class. After the class, they may or may not upload the slides with the answers. In addition, homework will also be made available on eDimension (or whatever site the prof chooses), and answers may be released after the due date.

Some mods adopt a flipped-classroom pedagogy, in which you will have to watch a lecture video and/or complete a quiz before the start of classes that week, two examples of which are 10.012 Introduction to Biology and 10.009 The Digital World, which were part of the previous Freshmore curriculum. Additionally, all HASS mods will make their readings available at least the week in advance, as it is necessary for students to do the readings before class, for any meaningful discussion to take place.

Some mods will also provide links to relevant textbooks, and you should be able to access at least the main textbook online via the SUTD library portal. Of course, there is also MIT OCW and other online resources that you can take a look at!

In addition, SUTD boasts a very hands-on curriculum, so you can expect to have activities in class, as well as lab sessions for some mods. In light of HBL and possibly safe distancing measures even after we return to campus, this may not always be possible, but as a student, I can only make guesses. Particularly for HBL, lessons may not always be live, but if you're unhappy with the format, you can always feedback to your instructors!"
HypothesisTesting,5,"Yes, you may select any pillar! The one you indicated in your SUTD application is probably mostly to gauge interest in the pillar for the whole cohort, so it serves the admin side more.

You will select the pillar of your choice in MyPortal. You may see this answer by u/ThumbsUpMan117 [in this thread here](https://www.reddit.com/r/sutd/comments/fwg2ij/choosing_a_pillar_after_freshmore/), reproduced below:

In terms of ethnicity, again a good mix of Chinese, Indians, Malays and Indonesians.

pauldestiny98,1,It’s possible. Just don’t let it affect your work and projects. It’s selfish.

huixiang01,14,"I can offer an opinion to you even tho I took physics in JC. And soon-to-be sophomore here.

For the first term, it is pass/fail term, meaning if you pass the physics course, it will reflect as a pass. Hence, you could try out different techniques of studying. In addition to your pass/fail term, there will be 2 SUs for term 2 and 3. Study hard for them and use them wisely.

Consultation for physics professor is readily available. You can email them for help, ask in piazza, book a consultation slot, ask queries during lesson(yes, there will be 2 professors in a lesson, one for you to consult during lesson if you are so lost, and the other one for conducting lessson) and also after lesson(professors here willingly stay back for you to ask, like can usually be up to 1 hour plus)

Some seniors will also volunteer as TAs for lesson to help you out. Some go for an extra mile, such as creating a dedicated telegram group. So, this depends.

Culture in SUTD is quite good. Make friends with smart people and ask them questions. Most of them would answer cus first, they can revise too, and second, friends. But just don't kajiao them too much. For me, I would rather kajiao professor for help. But if professor is sophiscated for you, friends are good."
lohtech,3,"Hi I have a friend who was in the same situation as you. He did not take Physics in JC and was intent on going into ISTD from the start. 

Not going to sugarcoat things but I believe he struggled quite a bit with tests and exams and may have gone for bootcamp(s) before. 

It is great that you are already anticipating the upcoming challenge and this won't be the only challenge you face in School. Uni is a good time where you come to terms with yourself and push yourself to greater heights. 

Here are some advice if you find yourself struggling: 

* Manage expectations. Instead of A+/A/A- could you aim for B+/B/B-? Or even just aim not to go Bootcamp? Well even if you do, that's far from the end of the world. 
* There are S/U opportunities in Freshmore which allows you to SU 1 - 2 physics mods out of a total of 3. Just aim to pass and you will be much happier and less stressed out. 
* Do your homework consistently, and do it with study groups so you can clarify. For the first term, the content is quite similar to A-levels' Newtonian Mechanics. Your friends should be very willing to help you. 
*  Always consult the Profs. Freshmore Profs are mostly excellent at teaching and wonderful people. Utilise the office hours, which are often under-utilised when an exam is not in sight."

Be sure to get the Education discount if you’re gonna get a new machine."
WING1123,3,"I am going to be an ISTD sophomore and I have been using a MacBook. Macbook gives you a UNIX based terminal, which is highly similar to the Linux command and very powerful to modify files/environments and make your experience in setting up environments smoother. Of course you can do the same on a windows machine with a bit of tweak or simply install a Linux virtual environment, but I personally find the terminal on mac more convenient with a more stable OS. Just my personal experience and opinions, hope that helps :)"

Learnt about UI/UX, applied design thinking to application design on top of designing products in term 2. Also got to make a visit to Apple’s office too to learn about them. Amazing experience.

ThumbsUpMan117,2,"personally I've never attended ILP but the one mod that rekts most of my peers and juniors is math. the math can be pretty brutal in the pillar years as they build on your freshmore fundamentals.

HypothesisTesting,1,"Hello! I did not attend ILP so I am unable to comment on it, but I can answer your question about chem and bio.

With the freshmore curriculum revamp (overview: https://www.sutd.edu.sg/Education/Unique-Academic-Structure/Freshmore-Subjects), the compulsory chem and bio mod is now known as Science for a Sustainable World (link: https://www.sutd.edu.sg/Education/Unique-Academic-Structure/Freshmore-Subjects/Science-for-a-Sustainable-World). Based on the course description, the content coverage/focus seems to be slightly different from what I had two years ago, but without knowing the detailed syllabus, I cannot comment further on what it will entail.

Additionally, with the introduction of electives in Term 3, there is an elective mod called Science and Technology for Healthcare (link: https://www.sutd.edu.sg/Education/Unique-Academic-Structure/Freshmore-Subjects/Science-and-Technology-for-Healthcare) that you may select. This will cover some chem and bio concepts particularly relating to healthcare, and the bio portion appears to be similar to what I had in 10.012 Introduction to Biology, but again without knowing the detailed syllabus, I cannot comment further (though the course description in the linked page should give you a pretty good idea of the focus!)."
stateofbrave,1,I have taken ILP because it was compulsory for me. Are you from poly or jc? If you are a jc kid that took H2 math/physics then don't bother because your jc knowledge is more than sufficient.
WING1123,2,"All modules in Term 1 are not graded, but I am not sure how it goes for summer. To be frank it is hard to fail a HASS module in my experience as long as you attend lessons, do the reading and write sensible essays. From what I heard from my seniors the only way to fail HASS is skipping lessons lol.

I think it is great to be able to clear 1 HASS module in summer because your can have 1 less module in one of the future semesters. This is esp helpful for those hectic semesters like ISTD term4. And before this special arrangement this year, one can only clear HASS or other modules in summer by travelling overseas to attend summer school, which is part of GLP, if you are awarded that scholarship. (of course you can also self-pay to go to summer schools but that's a lot of money)

About the GPA part I think it really depends on you as it can be different cases for different people. Personally I think it should be do-able because I think if you sign up for the HASS SSP you only do one module for the summer period, so you have the time to put into the effort for that. In my personally expreience, I got good grade for hass essays (not HASS module hahaha) for those materials I'm interested in / have some opinions about. So it really depends on your understanding of the book / reading materials / essay topic.

I think you can only pick Term 8 HASS modules for this semester. You probably want to look at the HASS website to find the HASS courses offered and the topics. Also, some HASS modules have other assessments other than essays, like paper exams and projects. You can look at the syllabus to check that too."
nirodho,2,"It really depends on how much experience you have in these kinds of subjects. You might struggle in a philosophy elective, for instance, if you have no prior interest in the subject. Think also about whether your reading and writing skills are good or still need some work. While few fail HASS electives, getting a D is in some ways worse as you can't retake the course. So think about it carefully before jumping in!"

galaxyuser,2,Hey there. Send me your email and I'll forward the email to you right away!
cavalier96,4,Why does any of this matter
zackteo,6,"If you really think about it, due to the 2 SUs you are given (on top of term 1 being pass fail) and another 2SUs from the Covid situation, you GPA literally only consists of grades from 4 subjects. 

This means that your grades are still very volatile, in that you can definitely have some leeway to pull it up, provided you work at it! (Of course perhaps your targets have to be realistic, say 3.5 or 4) 

That being said, you are feeling bummed out, upset, perhaps it's time to reflect about what decisions you made along the way that caused you to be in such a state. How did you spend your time in year 1? 

Is it a mismatch between effort with expectations? You need to find out what important to you - your grades, relationships or areas you are passionate in, etc. And there's different measures of ""success"" for different areas. 

GPA isn't everything, but you must also consider what's acceptable to you.

Anyhow, this term hasn't been easy and if circumstances made it difficult for you, don't beat yourself up too much. But, you gotta try to pick yourself up :) Then perhaps you can use the holidays to plan and execute the incremental steps to where you want to be! 

On a final note, University is ultimately a place to learn and grow. So tough and painful times now, if taken right, become periods of growth and improvement for our future selves :)"
ThumbsUpMan117,4,"afaik you cant repeat freshmore mods unless you've failed them. also if you've failed mods, you put a max cap on your grade when you repeat it (it was a max C grade in my year)

unfortunately pillar years arent going to be that much easier. It's kinda hard to fail mods but trying for that A is going to be difficult if you are already struggling this hard. 

I hate to be the bearer of bad news but unless you're gonna bust your ass off like 2x-3x effort, you'll prob be stuck in your current GPA range. in the end grades arent everything and you might want to take the time to reevaluate what's worth doing.

Good Luck"
Bokchops,1,"Bro, to put things in perspective, job market is pretty bad now. So people are graduating jobless in Singapore and some folks are getting furloughed. You’re year 1 now, you’ll be in a great position when the market rebounds when you graduate. The more crucial phase for you is likely next year when you do your penultimate internship. 

That said, if you’ve got no internship. Use the time to build up skills by taking on volunteer projects. Learn to make a website or run some data analysis for charities. It builds up your skill and portfolio when hunting for a job later on. 

GPA is like a filter pass the HR. You should try and get the best but my take is you don’t need to bring it to like 4.5+. What’s a good number, I’d say 4+ or if you push it 3.75+. The reason is because if you understand the hiring process, you can back door past HR. Imagine you wanna join shopee (they pay a lot btw) as a web backend dev or a ba, you could apply through the front door... or you could build up your portfolio, network yourself on medium or something, get to know the tech lead or someone there via a shopee hackathon or whatever, sell yourself. Then ask him/her for an internship and possibly a conversion. 

At that point in time, when the business says, “hey I want this guy”.. you think HR gonna day.. “but his gpa not 10.0..”? Well that’s the reality. Networking and then getting backdoor entry. If you think about it again, there’re like tons of firdt class from NUS, NTU, SMU and if you’re competing for top tier firms, Harvard Oxbridge ivies, what’s a 5.0 in SUTD gonna amount to?

Well.. I’ve answered with the assumption that your end game is to go out to the industry after you graduate and what to do now. But if your end game is to the academic route (i.e PhD, masters) you’re pretty much fucked. Do tons of research and hope you get 1/2 publications (easier said than done)

Regardless of your choices, you still gotta put in some hardwork and sacrifice henceforth. Good luck."

ilovesg123,3,Do yall think it better to clear a credit bearing module now while working or do it together when school starts?
WING1123,5,I think the new curriculum is really good in my opinion. Can do up to 3 internships as there are 3 vacations. Also being able to clear one HASS is also a great bonus for this incoming batch.

positron559,1,Any advice on what to choose for the summer programs? Especially HASS cos I'm not sure what to expect.
valleyofpeace,1,"Hi the SSP has a option where we can undertake a UROP, can any seniors who have gone through UROP during their own years share their own experience on how their UROP was? Did you go in with any background on research or with a research topic mind? I feel like doing a project would be a more useful way for me to learn during this time instead of taking advanced credit modules but I’m not sure how’s it gonna be"
marisateri,1,"anybody know anything about OMEx? if we're not interested in applying for the special summer programme...? I read we have to mail things to singapore too? Even if youre an overseas student...? Whatt is all of this, and you have 4 days to do it??? Someone please help!"
HypothesisTesting,2,"Yes, it is possible to “take” multiple tracks if you can fulfil the requirements for the tracks. I’m unsure of further details as I’m not from ISTD, and cannot find any further info on the website.

If you’re matriculating this year or later, you will actually have two free electives - although this may change if ISTD introduces a new core course in place of the previous Intro to Prob & Stats (moved to Freshmore for incoming batch onwards), or if they decide to introduce more requirements for the tracks you’re considering. Though if you’re currently a Freshmore, you might be out of luck in this regard."
HypothesisTesting,5,"Hello! I'm not sure of application to special programmes after one has been offered admission in SUTD, as typically the application to special programmes is done together with the original application. It would be best to email the Office of Admissions to enquire about the possibility of doing so!

re: chances of admission, I'm personally not sure as I did not apply, but since the typical application process for special programmes requires the applicant to write a 300 word essay, perhaps you can use that to your advantage."
try_harder_later,1,"Not 100% sure but i think for NS you can accept the current offer and apply again next year for the special programmes. As for the scholarship, you are not formally bound until you have signed the scholarship contract given during matriculation."
spillingcofveve,3,"Lmao all your mods gonna be different. Just take note of the project grading percentages, it's not worth putting too much effort when it's less than 20% of your grades. The bulk still come from exams and tests.

Good luck for coding hahahah."
WING1123,3,"Your curriculum gonna be diff from ours as I heard you have coding course in term 1, which I think is great because you can get to grow more technical skills and potentially have an easier time looking for an internship for the first summer. 

There is only one coding course in the old first-year curriculum and it’s pretty beginner-friendly in my opinion. It teaches you everything from scratch so I think it should be fine. Also you don’t have to worry too much about grade in the first sem because all mods in term 1 are ungraded. Term 1 is for you to explore :)"
HypothesisTesting,3,"Hello!

For information on the new Freshmore curriculum you can take a look at [this page](https://www.sutd.edu.sg/Education/Unique-Academic-Structure/Freshmore-Subjects)! In addition, the Science and Math cluster also has [their own website](https://smt.sutd.edu.sg/), and you can take a look at the courses (almost all Freshmore) that they offer [here](https://smt.sutd.edu.sg/education/undergraduate/courses/) (though the information here is not much different from the first link).

The biggest difference with the previous Freshmore curriculum is that the introdutory programming module has been shifted to Term 1 from Term 3, and you get to select two electives (out of four offered) in Term 3, which would give you a taste of what the related pillars will be like. In addition, and in particular for prospective EPD/ESD/ISTD students, Probability & Statistics has been moved down from pillar terms to Term 3, which should free up another module slot in pillar term.

My favourite part about Freshmore would have to be the 2D projects (especially Term 3's!), where I was able to experience how the various modules were interlinked. There were sleepless nights and everyone was staying up in class together to work on the projects, but it was an experience I personally enjoyed and cherished! I am not sure what the 2D project would be like in the new Freshmore curriculum (and especially now if students cannot physically be in school, but I hope we'll be able to go back to physical classes soon), but I am sure it will help to illustrate how the new combinations of modules are interlinked.

Other than the 2D projects, there will also be 1D projects, as well as regular assignments and tests/quizzes/exams throughout the term for assessment purposes. While SUTD markets itself as being more project-oriented, this does not always translate into projects taking up a higher weightage in the overall grade for modules, which is annoying imo. However, Term 1 is a completely pass/fail term - it's really intended for you to explore, so make the most of that grade-free term! In addition to that, you also get another 24 credits' worth of modules (equivalent to two full-term modules) to exercise the pass/fail option on in Freshmore.

In Freshmore, generally you'll have at least one class every day (you can't choose your cohort, nor can you arrange your own timetable for classes, possibly with the exception of the two electives in Term 3; I am not sure of how it will be carried out), though classes end 1.30pm latest on Wednesdays and Fridays! The earliest a class can start is 8.30am, and Freshmore classes generally end by 6pm on Mondays, Tuesdays, and Thursdays. One can expect a combination of lectures (usually an hour long and once a week) and cohort classes (usually 1.5 to 2.5 hours, depending on module) for Freshmore modules, though some (such as the previous curriculum's Physics modules) may not have lectures.

Must you go to school every day? Er, well, no one is really forcing you to go to class, and OSA isn't going to knock on your hostel door in the morning demanding your presence in class :P

I personally found The Digital World to be quite beginner-friendly (though to be fair, they use Python which definitely helps), and I had no coding background before matriculating into SUTD too. Some of your peers will definitely have some coding/programming experience, so you can ask them for help as well! However, I must again mention that with the Freshmore curriculum change, The Digital World will be replaced by [Computational Thinking for Design, so there will be changes in the syllabus, namely in the inclusion of visual programming (or programming in the architectural design context)](https://smt.sutd.edu.sg/education/undergraduate/courses/computational-thinking-for-design). I'm not an ASD student, so I don't know what the latter really entails, but it sounds fun haha

As cliched as it is, everyone has 24 hours a day, so it's up to you how you want to spend your 24 hours each day. Some people choose to focus more on their studies, but many students in SUTD engage in at least one Fifth Row (though they've all been virtually suspended since early this term) on a somewhat regular basis. Some Fifth Rows need more commitment (especially if one decides to take on an EXCO position), while others are more laid back. In this sense, it's really up to you! I was personally in two Fifth Rows in Freshmore, though I dropped one at the start of Term 3 as I wanted more time for other things.

I hope this helps you in making your decision! :)"
blueberrypie31,3,"Not true btw. The 2 weeks is for those who are confirm accepted. I received my offer near end of 3rd week after my interview. Likely cus some students reject offer, thats when the school sends offers to those in waiting list. Even then just give it around a month at max. You never know. Wishing you good luck! ~\(≧▽≦)/~

Scholarship I heard is actually pretty damn competitive. Looking at your info it seems like you might have a good chance. The fact that you managed to get shortlisted itself is pretty damn impressive."
ilikepogo,2,"Hi I was feeling the same as u, but I received my admission + scholarship offer on 13 April (Interview was on 18 March, ISTD also). Good luck!"
HypothesisTesting,8,"You will get what you select, that’s it! You may also change your pillar a maximum of once throughout your candidature."
demi12395,1,"Hey there! Congrats on getting in SUTD. you are a future SUTDent. The school does have partnerships with HP and DELL and provides good deals. But I feel its almost the same or even better for you if you can get from Apple store using the student offer. I believe students get $100-150 which is significant. Alternatively, if you're a hunter, then you might find some less expensive used laptops in carousell, you just need to hunt for it. Hope you enjoy your student life! All the best"
HypothesisTesting,5,"E-learning allllll the way for everyone now D: Exact medium (eg. live vs recorded), however, depends on the prof and class.

Some project requirements, especially those with physical prototype components, have been changed here and there. Finals have either been cancelled (with weightage moved to other components/new components), or moved to online/take-home.

Campus is more or less closed, and most local students have been evicted from hostel (similar to other unis).

I’m personally not satisfied with this situation, I much prefer being in a classroom/LT during class time because I feel better being immersed in the whole environment (quite a blow to our hands-on curriculum, really). In addition, the changing of project requirements is a little frustrating; while it is nice that some projects will take a little less work now, sometimes that work is the appealing part (eg. physical prototypes!), at least for me, but it’s not like the instructors have much of a choice as to how to change things up anyway.

It must be said that our professors and lecturers are putting in a lot of work behind the scenes so that our learning can continue, recording lecture videos, setting up and replying on discussion forums, discussing and doing paperwork to change the overall grade weightages and project requirements, and so on. They may not make decisions that please everyone (lots of conflicting opinions between students and all), but no one ever does so yeah lol

This entire situation is no fun for anyone at all, but this is what the whole world has to deal with, so we aren’t special in that sense HAHA"
galaxyuser,2,The matriculation has been postponed to some time in September 2020. Just received the notification via email today. Hope that clarifies.
ainlovescode,1,This is probably not the best platform to ask. You may want to consider contacting the SUTD office.
ainlovescode,3,"ISTD senior here! I can't really say about NUS/NTU since I don't know anyone in CS there.

I believe the freshmore year gave me a better idea of the pillars that I want. Perhaps I initially wanted to get into ISTD, but after freshmore year, I want to pursue EPD more instead. I have that option, and still take interdisciplinary electives in ISTD. So imo freshmore year was useful to me getting a foundation in all the courses (Except archi) in SUTD, allowing me to make a more informed decision of my pillar years.

""Computer scientist"" is a very broad term to mean someone who studies computer science. Specifically for ISTD, you can expect to get into more development-centric careers like ML, cybersec, software engineering. ISTD definitely touches on the foundations of CS, and uses hands-on projects to allow us to actually apply the theories we learnt.

Personally, I'm a big fan of ISTD education being more than just CS. As a tech creator, you will not only work WITH people, but work for/serve people. HASS (Humanities, Arts and Social Sciences), which a compulsory elective in every semester, allows you to study the humanities i.e. how people and societies work. All the presentations and projects you have to do as aprt of your ISTD/SUTD education also helps you gain experience working with people, and giving great presentations (i.e. build good communication skills which is a seriously underrated skill nowadays.)

Ultimately, it depends on how you define breadth and depth of your studies, and what your post-graduation goal is - to be a CS academic, or work in code? If you are the latter, I feel ISTD does a great job at prepping you for the industry. If you are the former, NUS/NTU may be a better option, or you can do research projects within ISTD in SUTD."
stateofbrave,1,"Basic theoretical knowledge (Algorithms, calculus etc) is pretty much the same as NUS/NTU. However I personally feel that NUS offers much more courses that allow you to dive deep into the theoretical parts of CS (Programming language implementation etc), its good if you want to go into research. Otherwise the core mods in ISTD is pretty much sufficient. 

That being said I feel that ISTD has much to improve, and the school is working on it (offering stuff equivalent to software engineering track, expanding our choice of electives etc). But if you can get into NUS I would highly recommend you go to NUS instead. Idk much about NTU."
galaxyuser,1,"Hi there, congrats on you getting an offer for STEP. I'm one that failed in getting the STEP offer, but instead was given the Global Distinguished Scholarship, which I feel is a better one than the Merit one.  


Not going to answer any of your questions since I'm not in a position too. I'm just here to congratulate you :)"
DarthCrayon,1,"Hi. I am a STEP Sophomore under the STEP scholarship. Offering the STEP Programme with SUTD Undergraduate Merit scholarship (SUMS) is news to me as all the STEP students I know are covered under the STEP Scholarship (covering up to 10 terms with study-related allowances to USA and China). SUMS only covers up to 8 terms (4 years) so do take note that 2 terms will bite into your pocket (as well as the overseas allowance/spending).

&#x200B;

I'll answer your questions in accordance.

1. Your first question is a little ambiguous so do comment what you'd like to know specifically. STEP students do come up with start-ups and they are supported by faculty. Successful/Flops wise, I cant quantify my answer but there is a fair share in both areas.
2. As mentioned above, I was unaware that SUTD offered the programme with SUMS. SUMS will not cover your allowance in US and China. I don't think I can share how much STEP Scholarship covers for allowance but I have heard seniors spend an average of $20k-$30k, depending on your lifestyle too. Do note that SUMS covers 8 terms but STEP is a 10 terms programme.
3. About 20-25
4. STEP does not have a unique set of professors dedicated to teaching STEP students. Our professors are SUTD faculty members. There is a whole thread on this and I will not dwell into it.
5. Personally, no. But this boils down to how receptive you are to the programme and how much you believe in it. Any programme will bound to have people ""regretting"" their life decisions.
6. SUTD STEP with ISTD gives you an added dimension of Entrepreneurial Skills. I do not know NUS's curriculum inside out so I will refrain from commenting but I do know that you can still take some electives gearing towards entrepreneurship. Certification for this will of course differ.
7. The school's vision for STEP students is to either initiate/work in a start-up or to be hired as intrapreneurs in MNCs. Prospects are what you make of your opportunities and I believe there are plenty. Working in a big tech firm will boil down to your competency. STEP will bring out an individual that is comfortable with Engineering and Business/Entrepreneurship and after talking to many Recruitment Officers, this is very well sought-after. That said, do not enter any programme feeling entitled to a certain outcome. We all work hard."
reddit123_880,1,Hi! May I know what is the range of A-Level rank points to enter the SUTD STEP programme?
PaintWorried1783,1,May I know what is the GPA requirements for poly students who are looking at the STEP scholarship? ( Probably based on seniors exp?)
galaxyuser,1,"1) What /u/liverbirdeye has mentioned.

2) Orientation may be cancelled altogether. If it does not get cancelled, it will happen from 10 Sep to 12 Sep. Term 1 begins on 14 Sep 2020.

3) Like what /u/liverbirdeye has mentioned, just email [admissions@sutd.edu.sg](mailto:admissions@sutd.edu.sg).

4) If you do matriculate early, all SSP programmes begin on 18 May, with applications open from 1 to 8 May. Lessons will be home-based online learning until the COVID-19 situation eases to a level that can facilitate on-campus lessons. I would not reckon that on-campus lessons will be able to resume until about August 2020 at the earliest, given that there are still plenty of asymptomatic COVID-19 carriers in the society that have not been tested for the virus.

Under SSP, there are 5 programmes running in the term from May to August. They are:

1. Special Summer Integrated Learning Programme (ILP)

The ILP has two programmes, and you may choose to take up either Maths+Physics or Chem+Bio. Maths+Physics runs from 18 May to 26 June, while Chem+Bio runs from 6 July to 14 August. The ILP carries **NO** academic credits, and is **compulsory** **for students who have been conditionally admitted on ILP**.

Below is the **scheduled timetable** for the respective groups. You will be grouped into either A or B.

|Group|Weekly Timetable (10h/wk)|
|:-|:-|
|SS ILP A|Tue 9AM–11.30AM, 1PM–3.30PM; Thu 9AM–11.30AM, 1PM–3.30PM|
|SS ILP B|Wed 9AM–11.30AM, 1PM–3.30PM; Fri 9AM–11.30AM, 1PM–3.30PM|

**Students who are accepted conditionally via ILP3 will be auto-enrolled. No application is required.** If you are **keen to take on this course**, kindly apply from (inclusive of start and end dates) **1 to 8 May**. 

Application outcome and lesson details will be made known to you (for both ILP3 enrollees and non-ILP3 enrollees) **by 14 May**.

&#x200B;

2. Special Summer Modelling and Analysis (SS Math) and Special Summer Physical World (SS Physics)

SS Math and SS Physics are each **12 credit** modules that **count toward graduation requirements**.

The **SS Math** module is the same syllabus as and of the same rigour as Term 1's Modelling and Analysis. Likewise, the **SS Physics** module is the same syllabus and of the same rigour as Term 1's Physical World.

**Students who PASS the respective modules in Special Summer Programme term are EXEMPTED from having to take them in Term 1.**

**YOU MAY ONLY CHOOSE 1 OF THE 2 SS modules.**

**Both run from 18 May to 21 August, with a break in Week 7 (29 June to 5 July), and the EXAM in Week 14. EXAM dates are always Wed, Thu, Fri, with the potential to use Sat as an extra exam date if need be. Put into dates, they will be 19, 20, 21, and possibly 22 August.**

Below is the **scheduled timetable** for the respective groups. You will be grouped into either A or B.

&#x200B;

|Group|Weekly Timetable (5h/week)|
|:-|:-|
|SS Math A|Tue 10AM–12.30PM; Thu 10AM–12.30PM|
|SS Math B|Tue 2PM–4.30PM; Thu 2PM–4.30PM|
|SS Physics A|Tue 10AM–12.30PM; Thu 10AM–12.30PM|
|SS Physics B|Tue 2PM–4.30PM; Thu 2PM–4.30PM|

If you are **keen to take on this course**, kindly apply from (inclusive of start and end dates) **1 to 8 May**. 

Application outcome and lesson details will be made known to you **by 14 May**.

&#x200B;

HypothesisTesting,2,"Personally I’ve no clue, you’ll have to contact the admissions office or the office of student admin for that. Orientation, however, will definitely not be the same, if it were to happen (in which case, would not be any time soon).

In the event that the intake is not delayed, I’d guess that classes will likely be conducted through home-based learning, and the incoming freshmores also wouldn’t be moving into hostel any time soon.

In the event that the intake is delayed, perhaps the change in academic calendar will be pushed forward from AY2022/2023. But of course, this is all just a guess!"
ThumbsUpMan117,10,"Joining SUTD

Cons: Most people dont know where it is. Most people will automatically assume it's a private uni. Most people will assume you picked SUTD cos you cant get into NUS/NTU. Food options are limited. Freshmore math is brutal and if you cant hack it then you are gonna struggle for the rest of your 4 years. Workload can pile up so you literally have no time to fall sick

Pros: Amazing fab lab. We have 3D printers and laser cutters and C&C machines and a well stocked electronics lab. Amazing undergrad research opportunities. You wanna join a existing cool research project? Sure. You wanna start your own research project and get funded. The school is happy to give you the money. Amazing overseas exchange opportunities. Close knit communities. Freshmore stick with the same class for 3 terms. It's a small cohort so everyone sort of knows each other very quickly and its much easier to pick your group mates for projects. Very hands-on approach to learning with the (insane) number of compulsory projects. Prepares you very well for the working life. 

tl;dr: uni is tough. but so is every where else. come for the shiny bubbles and trinkets. stay for the culture."
WING1123,1,"3.5 corresponds to B and B is the average grade for each class in year 1 ( I’m year 1 so I’m not sure about later years). I personally think as long as you attend class and do your homework carefully it should be fine, at least that’s what I have experienced in year 1 so far haha."
galaxyuser,1,"cGPA 3.5 means maintaining average B grade per module for all 7 terms (Terms 2 to 8).

For payouts, the stipend is paid out at the start of every academic term. Hope that clarifies."
Brainaic5,2,What did you apply with and what is your GPA? You applied quite late so they may take awhile. You should get an email either this week or the next.
stateofbrave,5,"Freshmores don't need to apply for student housing, they are allocated a double room by default. 

No you cannot choose your roommate. They will get you to do a quiz to find out more about your lifestyle habits, to assign someone whose lifestyle is more compatible with you. 

Your whole class will be grouped together, so your roomie is most likely someone from your class or from a neighbouring class. It gives that communal living experience which is quite different from other unis -- your entire floor is your classmates. 

Eh no co-ed. 

If you don't want housing after year 1, ignore all the rules (lmao). 

But if you stay far away and want to secure housing: 

1. Don't do stupid stuff. Like drinking alcohol and getting caught, being too loud etc (if someone complains then shit might happen) 
2. Just need to attend 3 events in your freshmore year (1 per term). Can just do the bare minimum, in housing's eyes 3 events and 8 events is the same priority lmao

I guess just don't be an asshole to your roomie ba. Enjoy your freshie years, pillar year class is quite different and I miss the freshmore times haha"
HypothesisTesting,5,"With the impact of Covid-19, Orientation has undergone very drastic changes, especially in the past few weeks (as far as I am aware; I am not a member of the organising committee). I believe Ocomm is still planning and all (since there is a chance that Orientation will go on, and we have to be prepared for that scenario). Perhaps it is too early to say whether it will go on or not. Schools may close and remain closed during the planned Orientation period, and so many more things beyond Orientation would be affected by that too (think the start of classes, and maybe the entire academic calendar could be thrown off). In any case, I am certain that Ocomm/the relevant admin offices will inform you in due time."
HypothesisTesting,1,"As an update, I have heard that Orientation has been cancelled unfortunately. I’m not sure about the impact of this situation on the hostel check-in as well as the mode in which classes will be conducted though, and I’d suppose they’re currently being discussed."

PS: My junior as mentioned that the subject he struggled with most is math. There are 3 compulsory math courses in freshie and they are difficult even for fresh JC kids. I suggest some revision or attending the bridging courses if you do get in to SUTD."
WING1123,2,"It’s new to me that some ppl withdraw from STEP. But why tho? It’s such a good programme.

The first year curriculum part is very true cus I personally can’t find a single reason why everyone has to learn chem and bio in the first year and the lack of technical course in the first year curriculum makes It really difficult to find a good internship in a big company in the first summer."

SUTD really does take both your grades and extracurriculars into consideration before shortlisting your for interview. Keep that in mind.

That being said, be mentally prepared for all possibilities. Try to at least make the most of your time in SUTD - the culture, teaching style and accessibility of profs here are quite different from NTU NUS."

Well I guess just like the previous comment, it is better to wait and see. You may want to apply other schools for some sense of security."

WING1123,3,"For the exchange part, the difference is that people who have scholarships like GLP (and STEP, I’m not sure about how STEP is like regarding their exchange in Berkeley), their travel to US/Europe is fully funded by the school. You can still apply for exchange self-paid even if you are not on such scholarship and the bar is usually easy to hit (except Stanford IHP which requires a 4.0 GPA). Just take note that the fees for self paid can be quite expensive. For example, the tuition fees and accommodation fees in Berkeley can be up to 7-8kUSD and the number is even a bit higher for Stanford IHP in summer. About other places like Europe I’m not so sure but I think won’t be very cheap either.

EDIT: ok the STEP one is not really exchange it’s a one year master programme."
stateofbrave,1,"Not sure about STEP, but I know that there are mid term scholarships available too.

According to my knowledge some full term scholarships guarantee a place in programmes like Global Leadership Program etc. We do advertise ourselves as giving everyone equal opportunity for exchange tho, summer programs and exchange programs are relatively easy to secure in SUTD. Minimum requirement is that your gpa does not fall below 3."
HypothesisTesting,3,"Hello! I’m not sure how different the interview questions would be (I was a local applicant), but they will definitely ask you questions about yourself to better understand you as a person, such as what you’re interested in and what drives you, and also questions to understand why you’re interested in SUTD. These questions are to help the interviewer(s) have a better idea of whether you’re a good fit for SUTD, and whether SUTD is a good fit for you, so really it’s more of a chit chat than a really formal job interview!

Other than that, they might pose some academic-related questions to better understand your academic background, to ensure that you have sufficient foundation to cope with the rigorous curriculum in SUTD, in the event you matriculate here.

The best advice I can give you is probably to just be yourself and be honest. Good luck for the interview!"

ParkSooNam,2,Hi do you mind sharing the questions you were asked?
thorodin84,4,"An internship for the first summer might give you a better chance for a good internship for the second summer but I think it's not really that important. I went for exchange (China) in first summer and still got a pretty good internship in the second summer. I don't remember seeing a strong co-relation between what people did in first summer and the second summer.

Personally, I would recommend going for exchange since it is usually a fun experience. My China exchange was definitely a highlight of my SUTD years. Furthermore, your knowledge and skillset after Term 3 is likely not much so your choice of industry and work is quite limited in my opinion. Unless you are some coding or engineering god.

If you choose to do an internship, you can source it yourself instead of depending on myportal. It may or may not be an official one because of SUTD's requirements but it is still good to have more experience."
canceler80,1,Internship gets you money and experience. Exchange lose money but get memories
Bokchops,1,Exchange. Money can make back later. Memories got money also cannot get back. Want good internship just go networking.
stateofbrave,1,"If your goal is to do credit transfer, you can consider going for exchange. For me I chose to go for exchange in Term 6 instead so all the subjects are pass/fail. If you had exchange before that it is harder to go for another exchange. 

If you have gotten a good internship offer in your first year you can consider that also, however from my experience its really difficult to find internship in my first year. Quite a few people couldn't find internships in their first year and that is okay. 

As of now it's only the first round that is closed. There will be two more rounds of application in school portal. But I would advise you not to rely on school portal and source on your own. As long as you inform them by April they should be willing to accept. And that would take the stress off securing a compulsory internship in your Junior year. Tho from my experience it's really all about your experience and not so much what you learnt in school, so you can start thinking of what area you want to specialise in and start learning the language and frameworks needed (I see you want to go to ISTD) if you don't secure an internship, and if you do that your summer is not exactly wasted"

okaaiiix,2,"Hi might want to pay a visit to our AMA on discord to speak to some ISTD students there!   
[https://discordapp.com/invite/98kHC55](https://discordapp.com/invite/98kHC55)"
oneofus-oneofus,6,"1. Do the people who enter sutd already have experience in fields like programming and designing stuff?   
In short, no, except for Polytechnic students. But even then the level of the projects is still different. Some may come into SUTD with prior experience with how a computer might work, and with different levels of knowledge of computing languages (the rare C, C++ vs common Python vs non-existent Haskell)  
I also think a portfolio in general is quite rare.  

2. Is ASD a smaller cohort or something as compared to the other 4 pillars?  
No, but I don't have current population statistics. Either way, ASD is a very specific pillar, with focus generally only on Architecture. The other pillars have some sort of engineering focus, albeit in different areas.  

3. Does living near to SUTD give me a good enough reason to go SUTD?  
This depends on you more than anything else. However, I should note that both ASD and EPD would likely require you to do projects overnight on campus (not literally required by school, just that many projects take a lot of time) A minority of ASD/EPD students can probably say they have never worked overnight in school for any project before.  

4. Does the heavy workload and many side research/projects apply to everybody?   
Probably no, but you might not belong to the minority who are able to quickly finish projects."
kajiiiii97,2,If you want the virtual open house will have some discord server you can talk to seniors there!
HypothesisTesting,2,"Hello! I think u/oneofus-oneofus has given you a pretty good response, but I'd like to add on for questions 2 and 3. For some background, I am a current ESD Junior who did PCME in JC.

2) Indeed, ASD is a very specific pillar, and you graduate with a B Sc rather than a B Arts like at NUS Archi. I'm not an ASD student, and I'm not sure what you mean by the ""science"" behind archi. However, at ASD, you will be using more software (eg. Rhino, Unreal Engine) and doing more tech-y things (eg. 3D printing, laser cutting) than at NUS Archi, from what I've heard. I also feel that career options are more diverse for ASD students, compared to NUS Archi students, but you will have to do an M Arch if you want to become a practicing architect (compared to NUS Archi, where the B Arts is sufficient).

The current junior batch has like 40+ students, so yeah it is a smaller cohort for the current Junior (and Senior) batch compared to the other pillars, but cohort sizes really vary from batch to batch. I want to state that SUTD does not place a limit on the number of students who can go to each pillar for each batch, you will get what you choose.

BCME is not exactly unfavourable, and I wouldn't say it's unfavourable for the pillars. You'll probably have a more difficult time in freshmore, where you will have to meet Physics no matter what pillar you're eyeing, but being a Science student, the other modules may not be as tough as compared to being an Arts student. For pillar terms, whatever you learnt in JC just isn't enough anyway, so don't worry about that :D You'll have freshmore to build up your foundation, and I think that is sufficient. SUTD is big on tech-y things, so if you really want, perhaps you can look into picking up programming!

3) I personally have a 10-15 minute bus ride to campus. And honestly, the very first thing I told my interviewer when he asked ""Why SUTD?"", was the distance. It feels amazing to just hop on the bus and be home within the next 15 minutes, not gonna lie. However, it's definitely a different feeling: I can't stay up late with my friends in person, I can't do projects while staying up til dawn with my classmates beside me. Before midnight, I just have to leave in order to catch the last bus home, while my friends who have hostel don't have to rush off. Times like this I reminisce my freshmore hostel stay haha

However, if you're going to ASD or EPD, you'll very much appreciate the hostel stay. 30 minutes one-way is still quite a bit of time, and ASD and EPD isn't always suited for working remotely. The other pillars, not as much, except during crunch time (eg. ISTD Term 4 2D submission week). I have a friend in ASD, I once met her at the bus stop in early Term 4 when the sun still hadn't set, and she was like ""man, I really wish I had hostel"" despite staying relatively nearby (travel time of 30+ minutes, similar to your case). But of course, this is anecdotal evidence (though ASD is really Always Sleep Deprived).

Hope you'll enjoy our digital Open House today! :)"
PrimalReasoning,1,"Hi, current EPD senior here. Just to add on to the excellent answers already given:

2. Don't worry about BCME, you might have a slightly more difficult time in freshmore year as others have pointed out, but by the time you reach the pillar years everything is more or less completely new even for PCME students. One of my friends studied in SOTA before coming to SUTD, and he is currently one of the top students in EPD.

4.  As others have mentioned, the workload is generally higher for both ASD and EPD. However, at least on the EPD side, this can be slightly mitigated with better project planning (I can't speak for the ASD students).

On the EPD side, one good thing is that the curriculum is a fair mix of both EE and ME curriculums in other universities, so students will end up more well rounded than those from other universities, although the depth of knowledge will be lower. The projects also force you to go out and learn new skills and knowledge because chances are it will not have been taught at that point.

Whether you want to take up side research projects/personal projects is up to you. I know people who have done amazing startups/projects/research. On the other hand, I have also met people whose goal is just to make it through university with good grades and nothing else.  I'd say that meeting and making like minded friends help; my friends are all avid makers from various pillars"
lkc159,1,"I feel like my answers are going to be slightly outdated as I was from the graduating class of 2016 (2nd batch represent!), but here goes:

**1)** I had none when I applied in 2011 or 2012. I was the standard student with OK/pretty good grades, one sport, several team awards/achievements. No programming, no outside interests aside from my CCA, but I had big dreams for outside of SUTD. 

To be honest, I felt that SUTD back then was more interested in who I was as a person rather than what my grades were; more interested in what drove me rather than what I'd done. IMO they were looking for people who dared to try something new, who dared to take risks and break the mold, who could defer to tradition, yet dared to call it outdated. 

I've heard from a batch or two after me that in one student interview, some people were asked ""OK, you got A's. You know how to study. You have good CCA results. Many other people can do that. So *what makes you special? Why should we accept you?*

**2)** In my batch, my pillar (ESD) was the smallest. ASD I think was 2nd largest after EPD. I think my cohort had only 243, and there were only 40ish ESD grads. I was a PCME student.

But if your concern is over this:

>I took bcme which I think is unfavourable for the other 4 pillars...unless im wrong...?

Then fret not. The first three terms (freshmore) is a common curriculum, and will offer you the foundation required to succeed in later pillars. If you still feel worried, esp for a subject like physics, I think there used to be an IVP/bridging programme that starts before term and helps you to catch up. The first term or two covers mainly JC-concept subjects with a little more depth than at JC level, while term 3 onwards was where things  started to pick up.

My term 3 was Bio, Engineering in the Physical World (Phy), Modelling the Systems World (Math), and The Digital World (Coding). Yes, Archi students will be expected to know concepts such as Kinematics and Ideal Gases (Physics), Trigo, Linear Algebra and Multivariable Calculus (Math), Python, and so on.

**3)** I lived 45 mins away from SUTD Dover and like 3 stops away from SUTD ECC. It did make going to school in the morning easier. Honestly though, unless you're traveling across the country, it probably doesn't matter. 

That being said, there is something magical about being able to stay back in class till 12am, chilling with friends who live in hostel, enjoying the campus air at night, walking around at 3am in the morning and exploring the area. (Yes, I'm a little weird). There's a reason why some people remember SUTD fondly as ""Stay Up Till Dawn"" when it comes to 2D project submissions :P

And also I remember Prof. Jia Jia wandering back randomly into cohort classrooms (back at SUTD Dover) at 11pm for impromptu Q&A sessions and to ask us all how we were doing. Most of our professors (at least, for Freshmore and ESD) were hella awesome, and those that weren't as awesome were still okay.

**4)** It really depends on how deeply you want to immerse yourself in the university culture. I didn't struggle and I graduated with ~ GPA 4.00 (of course this was before the new grading, in my time it was just A=5, B=4, C=3 and no half grades); I was pretty much a straight B student. I didn't have any side projects in SUTD because I was too busy chasing my dreams outside of SUTD, but I still graduated well.

Hope this helps, and feel free to ask any more questions (if you think my answers are still relevant!)"
ttwj,1,"Hi, I’m Terence, the STEP Secretary. Unfortunately housing is not covered under the STEP Scholarship. The STEP Scholarship already covers your housing expenses during your exchange in both Zhejiang & San Francisco (which is very substantial as accommodation there is self-sourced). 

You may try to apply for the SUTD Education Opportunity Grant, but as you are on a scholarship already, it will be have to be evaluated on a case by case basis. (https://www.sutd.edu.sg/Admissions/Undergraduate/Financing-Your-Studies/Financial-Aid/SUTD-Education-Opportunity-Grant)

But given your enterprising spirit, I’m sure you will be able to find a solution!"
kazykiddo,2,"Hello! To answer your question, I will split up my answer into 3 things, our curriculum. our culture, and our community.

Our curriculum is quite different compared to NUS/NTU, as they have more theory based modules, whereas here at SUTD, we have a more hands on approach to our learning. Right off the bat, in Term 1, you will already embark on at least 1 project, and will have to learn to collaborate with a team in order to complete the project. Of course, my point of view is that of SUTD, so do ask around about how the other universities carry out practical work. 

Our culture is one that is collaborative and hands on. Students here learn early on that it really helps to work closely with your teammates and even classmates to figure out homework questions, or issues faced when doing projects. An extreme example was one when half the class was working the in the cohort classroom, testing their algorithms, sharing tips and ideas on how to optimise it to fit the given problem.

The community here at SUTD is great, and it really isn't just the community of students. Our professors, PhD students, researchers, and even the support staff are really friendly and approachable. In fact, thanks to the Undergraduate Research Opportunity Program, I got to know more about my professor's work, and also play a role in influencing the direction of the research. It is really because we are such a small school, that makes it possible.

The international community is quite sizable, but then again, I am a local student, so I cannot comment much about it. But I have friends from Thailand, Indonesia, and India, to name a few countries, so I guess we are as diverse as it gets.

As for the cost, I cannot comment as I am a local student, and have a tuition grant from the Government. I believe other international students are able to answer your question better.

Hope this helps. Feel free to ask other questions!"
HypothesisTesting,2,"Hello! For your third question, you can take a look at [this page](https://www.sutd.edu.sg/Admissions/Undergraduate/Financial/Financial-Calculator), which gives an estimate of S$18,976.80 in Term 1, for an International Student admitted in the year AY2019 on Tuition Grant.

However, I understand that you're looking for cost without the government subsidies. Completely unsubsidised tuition fee per term: S$30,307.75, compared to S$14,125 per term for an International Student admitted in the year AY2019, according to [this page](https://www.sutd.edu.sg/fees). For students admitted in the year AY2020, I'd guess you can tack on another approximately S$500 per term, following the trend.

As an ESD student (albeit a local student), I'd like to take the liberty to do some math modelling of my own:

* Tuition fees: let's round it up to S$31,000 per term for completely unsubsidised, International Student admitted in AY2020. Total tuition fees over 8 terms = 8 terms \* S$31,000/term = S$248,000
* Compulsory Miscellaneous Fees (CMF): S$211.00 per term for International Students. Total CMF over 8 terms = 8 terms \* S$211/term = S$1,688
* Hostel fees: varies from year to year, and depends on room type, but Freshmore stay will be slightly subsidised (for everyone). I will *try* to find an *upper limit* for this particular set of fees, so I will calculate double room for Freshmore, then single room (ensuite) for pillar terms, and include vacation stay. Since I do not know what the cost will be for the relevant years, I will just take the values on [this page](https://www.sutd.edu.sg/Campus-Life/Housing/Undergraduate-(Freshmore)/Payment-AY2019) and [this page](https://www.sutd.edu.sg/Campus-Life/Housing/Undergraduate-(Pillar)/Payment-AY2020). Total hostel fees (upper limit, hopefully) = S$4,141.80 + S$9,100.00 + S$11,900.00 + 2 \* S$10.70 (for housing application in pillar terms) = S$25,163.20 (again, this is hopefully close to the upper limit)
* Meals: really depends on your appetite, and whether you eat caifan every day for every meal, order GrabFood every day, cook your own food, eat supper every night, etc. I'll take S$25 average a day (hopefully this is a good upper limit), and calculate for every single day. But I'm getting lazy so let's approximate the number of days to be 3.33 years \* 365 days/year = 1,216 days (rounded up). Total cost of meals = 1,216 days \* S$25/day = S$30,400
* Books, personal expenses, etc.: honestly not too sure what this covers, so I'll just take the estimate from the webpage, S$1,350 in Term 1. Total cost = 8 terms \* S$1,350/term = S$10,800
* Transportation: as an international student, you will probably not be travelling as much as your local friends regularly, assuming 100% hostel stay. However, SUTD only has so many food options, and you'll definitely be travelling here and there to acquire materials for projects and stuff. I'd say S$20/week (<S$3/day) could work as an upper limit. Total cost = 172 weeks (about 3.33 years) \* S$20/week = S$3,440

In total, for an upper limit (hopefully) of the total cost of studying at SUTD for an International Student with zero subsidies, we have S$248,000 + S$1,688 + S$25,163.20 + S$30,400 + S$10,800 + S$3,440 = S$319,491.20

Hope this helps!"
poofma,2,"You will realise that SUTD is no different from the rest of the universities. Students who are conscientious and proactive will do well, no matter where they are. Students who are passive and wanting will not grow in SUTD either. The observation applies to all the perceived strengths and problems of SUTD - people, culture, initiatives, professors - if you are good, you will find good opportunities.

The only significant difference is that our Freshmore year is common, it is less convincing to blame your circumstances if you end your first year without friends. This interdisciplinary curriculum arrangement is not without tradeoffs.

If you live closer to SUTD, there is no harm studying here. Also do also ask us about the housing saga recently."
ainlovescode,2,"Nope. I had an NTU offer and an NUS interview but went with SUTD. I felt like the SUTD open house vibe was kore warm and friendly than NTU, NUS and SMU. (No shade to them tho).

I believed then and I still believe now that going to SUTD would just be better for my self-esteem and mental health. SUTD admin aside, the interviewing process does a great job of weeding out most of the elitist. I feel like almost everyone at SUTD is friendly and helpful.

The profs are also really accessible also. They teally do try to make an effort to hear your concerns and make time to reteach and review with you before exams. I heard from other uni friends that their profs are difficult to get ahold of.

All in all, I feel like SUTD atm has a great culture and everyone treats esch other with respect and care. I dont rmb the weird policies mentioned (but I heard some of my more onz, self-started friends say), but management does try to actually hear your POV"

My suggestion is that you take this last one week of holiday to just press the pause button and don't think about any work related things. Take a break. Try to separate your mind from your ""self"". Look at the bigger picture, and define your goal (don't have to think of 10 years in the future it's too complicated). You should start with something simpler and more easily defined. Maybe think of what do you want to achieve in the next term. Then see what are the things that stop you from obtaining your goals.

try_harder_later,3,"1 and 5: What is your budget? Do you have a current laptop that you can use until Year 2? You can install linux on most laptops for a unix env, or just run in a virtual machine. (i'm not inclined towards apple because their stuff is not worth the price lately). SUTD has partnered with the distributors to offer discounts on laptops after you matriculate; if you have a laptop that can open powerpoint 2010 you can get through term 1. PM me if you want to see the offers. 

2: Most people use their laptops to just mirror slides. If you want to annotate slides you can consider getting a 2-in-1, otherwise if you prefer notes on paper by themselves then no need. Some people (rich ppl imo) print out the slides and annotate those.

3: It needs to be a full sized SD card reader. Doesn't need to be fast, just to upload code to the 3D printers. If you don't want to carry your charger around, 6h battery life of browsing is needed. HDMI port if you can find it. You probably want a mouse for CAD, because the middle click button does stuff; if you get a com w/o full sized usb ports, get a bluetooth mouse.

4: I have a 24"" 1080p monitor. It works. No KB, but my com is a thinkpad. As above, you need a mouse. I wouldn't bring any screens larger than 27"" 16:9; if you can get a rotating stand coding is better in portrait (for me).

ryanndelion,1,"Hello u/GeneticPro, congrats on your offer! Just to check, is this the SUTD Undergraduate scholarship?"
HypothesisTesting,1,"Congrats on your offer!

Depending on the exact scholarship you are being offered, it could be either. But in either case, the subsidised tuition fees refers to the tuition fees after MOE’s Tuition Grant, which subsidises tertiary institution tuition fees for all eligible students, with the subsidised amount depending on whether one is a Singapore Citizen, Singapore Permanent Resident, or International Student. You can see the Tuition Fees page on the SUTD website for more details.

Whether it is a full-term scholarship or a mid-term scholarship depends on the scholarship itself; without more information I cannot say for sure. However, essentially you pay 0 tuition fees for the academic terms which the scholarship covers, assuming you have accepted the MOE Tuition Grant (else, I think the scholarship will not be awarded anyway since accepting the TG is necessary to be awarded the scholarship), which is what I think you are asking.

Btw, while tuition fees are covered, the Compulsory Miscellaneous Fees, Hostel fees (compulsory Freshmore stay and/or pillar stay), and other day-to-day living expenses most likely will not be covered (again, depends on the scholarship).

From what I’ve heard, most, if not all, scholarships require the student to maintain a CGPA of at least 3.5 (out of 5.0), which translates to a B on average. Is it hard? Well, I can only offer a biased opinion here."

Go NTU if possible. Employment rates are going to drop after 2021 since most of us cant even qualify for internships with a cgpa of 3.5 now. Dont be a fool and trust their shitty ass marketing like me and get out when u can."
Bokchops,4,"Just some context, my girlfriend’s from NUS. But that said, I would say you don’t have to worry about it. The long or short of it is that either the relationship will work out or it wouldn’t, but what’s more important I think for you over this period is your journey and growth. 

Over the next few years, you’ll have many milestones. From picking your pillar, finding your first internship, deciding whether you want to further your studies or start working to choosing whether to stay in Singapore for professional reasons or not. 

It wouldn’t help and isn’t easy to take a step back and look at it from such a grand angle. So what I’d suggest is just relax and go with the flow. You won’t have all the answers anyway. But what this would do is help put things in perspective, in case things go sour, at least you’ve managed your expectations. She’s just one encounter in your long eventful life journey. 

And lastly, it’s nice and romantic to meet a girl, fall in love and live happily ever after. Though I think it’d be best to date more girls (dating doesn’t mean committing, just hanging out). Don’t wanna call off a wedding after collecting your bto keys. Same for girls too"
canceler80,3,"I met my girlfriend during SUTD orientation. She didn’t stay in SUTD but went to NTU. 

We have been together ever since.

I did not have any issues balancing studies and relationship. However, i did graduate with 2nd Lower. 

I have no regrets with how my life has turned out. I am happy, and am working in a stable job. College life was fun too. Did all sorts of crazy things and i am still in contact with my mates. 

I would say think carefully what it is that you want in your life. Then work your way through that. Ultimately, life will work itself out."

ThumbsUpMan117,3,"if you have a up to date gaming laptop that should be good enough.

otherwise, you'll prob still scrape by with 4GB RAM and 8XX Nvidia GPU (or its AMD counterpart). 

if you are looking to do AI/ML or anything Data Analytics, might want to get more RAM and a better GPU. But most likely any big data zide projects are not gonna be runable on any laptop and it's more affordable to spin up cloud instances."
HypothesisTesting,2,"Personally, I'd go for minimum 256 GB SSD, so you'll have enough room for your programs to live on the SSD (128 GB really is not enough, and a HDD is just so slow once you've tried an SSD), and at least 8 GB of RAM (but 16 GB would be much, much nicer, especially if you intend to use your own laptop for 3D modelling or video editing or whatever). It'd be good to have a discrete GPU too, doesn't have to be super good, like an MX150 is good enough, unless you intend to do a lot more on your laptop I suppose?

Also, a good keyboard to type on.

Beyond these, it's up to your personal preferences and budget. I'm personally carrying around a 2.4kg budget gaming laptop with terrible battery life, which is honestly not that convenient (especially when I have to plug it in), but I do appreciate the 15"" screen and wonderful keyboard. If I could go back in time, I'd get a lighter laptop with better battery life, but still try to keep the 15"" screen and keyboard."
Osami_98,1,"Just sharing my experience after 2 terms.

SUTD is really a place of immense growth. Many of my friends who have come in knowing little or nothing have become extremely capable in the fields they are interested in (by fields I mean technical skills ie CADing, Manufacturing, Robotics, Electronics, etc). 

If you do have the opportunity that I had, try to survive on your current laptop (assuming you have one) for the first year. For classwork and in-class projects, there are very few things that an old laptop won't be able to do.

Take the opportunity to find what field you are interested in. Then use that knowledge to decide on key aspects of your purchase - weight, cpu power, gpu power, platform, etc"
p1nkp3ngu1n,3,Maybe insufficient food courts???
HypothesisTesting,3,"I like the hands-on curriculum here, projects over exams for me any day man. Of course, having the projects weigh more in the overall grade would be really nice, especially considering the amount of time they can take sometimes and how the university markets itself. Additionally, quite a few will ask for you to produce media such as posters and videos, so you get to practise the aesthetic type of design too, and not just Design.

You get a lot of opportunities in SUTD, but it's up to you to be proactive to take the chances. We've got quite a few UROPs, field trips, competitions, etc advertised to us, but it's up to you to take part in them.

Personally, I also really enjoy my Fifth Row, and that most of them have very low barriers to entry, like we have trial sessions (as in a session for the freshies to try out the Fifth Row before committing) rather than auditions, so it's usually not really like you have to be good or better than other people before you can join (coughcough dance groups coughcough). Of course, you'll have to put in the effort to get good if so you wish haha

Food options in SUTD are quite limited, I gotta agree. Even Changi City Point gets boring after a while. If you're willing to go a bit further, there's Simpang, Simei, Tampines, Bedok, but that requires really getting outside of school.

A big pet peeve of mine is the red tape, filling up paperwork is really no fun, but alas we're in Singapore soooooo it's hard to escape it :/

I have no personal experience with STEP or SHARP myself, so I cannot comment on that, except that it might be hard to find someone who can answer your question here based on their personal experience with the programme, especially for the latter as the first intake came in this year. Additionally, since SHARP is new, there's bound to be quite a bit of trial and error for the time being."
ainlovescode,3,"LIKES

\+ SUTD's interviews really do help bring together people who are (mostly) self-starters, generous and helpful. There's really a work-hard-play-hard + close-knit culture here. 

\+ It's really safe and school admin does try to take student feedback into consideration.

\+ Upper Changi MRT is connected to SUTD ;)

DISLIKES

\-  Not a lot of halal food options :( and a little pricey. Although I feel like it's more that SUTD is quite ulu AND has not so nice rental fees.

\- Projects at SUTD can be quite taxing because a good part of the projects need us to do our own groundwork outside what's taught in class. Profs are almost always there for us to run by ideas though."

Osami_98,1,"I know this sounds very much like propaganda.
But.... I think SUTD admissions really does assess a student holistically. I've had friends (JC mind you) that have come in despite horrendous rank points/grades. Admissions seems pretty leninet on giving interview slots, and really seem on giving the chance to those who fit the SUTD spirit (passionate, self driven, etc)

My 2cents are just give it a shot and not to worry!"
nixnixnix0909,1,"Do something that you have an interest and passion for, document it and be consistent (out side of academic achievements). you can add it to the essay if it allows, and elaborate in the interview. this would apply for other unis as well. All the Best.  


a teachers testimonial can suffice, but wont stand out."
HypothesisTesting,1,"I took the A Levels two years ago and applied last year. It’s been a little too long for me to remember exactly what I submitted (so not sure if I scanned in my testimonial, probably did though), but I do remember having to list a referee’s contact details! My referee then received an email, requesting a referral letter from her. If the application portal hasn’t changed too much, you can expect something similar.

There isn’t a need to ask your referee (not necessarily your form teacher) to write the letter now, but do give them a head’s up before putting their details down! iirc your application will only be considered after the admissions office receives the referral letter.

atb for your A Levels! :)"
ryanndelion,2,"Hi I'm international and it took them about 6 weeks to respond with the interview offer. So yea, just be patient and all the best!

HypothesisTesting,1,"I am not personally familiar with applications submitted during this time period, so take my words with a pinch of salt. In my opinion it is still rather early for applications as a whole, so I feel it’s not too much of a concern, but it is understandable that you feel worried!!

What category of qualifications are you applying with? Perhaps someone else who applied through a similar category would be more helpful"
ryanndelion,1,"Hey I know it's a little late, but I think so long as you have a good overall application, the sat doesn't matter too much. They tend to look more at your passion (essays and interviews-make sure you focus on those) and if you have perfect gpa in school, you should be ok wrt academic aptitude. I got in with relatively poor SAT scores as well, so don't worry too much :)"

ThumbsUpMan117,4,"I'm amazed this fking still exists lmao. kudos for finding it hahaha.

I think SUTD is a really good place to pursue your passions. There are alot of research projects you can join even from your first year and most of them don't require prior experience but passion. Don't have any existing projects you like? Just propose your own also and get funded to do them. The university is really supportive of student projects (esp if it's big and flashy and gets alot of attention). 

The not so great things are that there aren't alot of good profs. Uni profs aren't certified MOE educators which means some of them are absolutely garbage at teaching. Some courses are also not structured very well because they are new or the previous in-charge left. Alot of courses also tend to cover the breadth of the subject but course projects require you to go deep in depth. 
Hostel management is also kinda rigid about hostel rules so it's quite easy to get a official reprimand which makes it much harder to get a hostel place the next cycle. 

The skillset you graduate with is also kind of a mixed bag. Whichever specialization you pick is going to be fraction of your total mods pick per sem. Which means that you have to pick mods not related to your specialization. Whether that's a good or bad thing you'll have to decide by yourself. Some industries really favour trans-disciplinary thinking but some prefer in-depth knowledge.

In the end, your experience in SUTD is ultimately up to your choices. I chose to hang out with over-achievers (the type that are always in the marketing material) and that spurs me to accomplish above and beyond. I was never the smartest one in my group, but I was always learning."
BruttherJOE,2,"Am a freshmore (first year student)  


As for school culture, everyone generally helps each other out, as maybe opposed to the other unis (I've heard stories from my friends in other unis that some people deliberately borrow out all the textbooks and dont return them during test period)  


Like you, I stay in the West. (CCK-BP area) Like you, I pondered upon choosing SUTD but ultimately chose SUTD as my first uni (and don't regret it.) I currently stay in till the Friday where I go home. Why did I choose SUTD? its just because of the research and learning opportunities. Theres just so much to do, theres never enough time even if you dont sleep. Academics is something we all have to do, but I choose to fill my remaining time with non-curriculum projects because these technical skills that I learn from doing these projects will definitely help me in the future. As an A level student myself, I believe we are already fundamentally behind the poly students.   


If you do come to this school, I would advise you not to focus too much on acads, but rather learn stuff, do stuff, build your portfolio, and prepare yourself for work. I dare say the path is not clear and you have to build your own path if you come here. But overall the process will be fun (and paradoxically, soul sucking too). If you do choose to go to the other Unis, the path is probably laid for you.  


Here's to hoping I'll see you around."
Osami_98,2,"Perhaps a more relevant question is, what are you looking to get out of your university experience?


Like all universities, hall/hostel culture is strong. Perhaps in a different way - by staying up for the numerous projs we take up. 

Given where you stay, staying in hostel for your whole university journey is a near given. But are you willing to sacrifice your time at home with your family for your university experience? Are you looking to push yourself hard these few years, taking up numerous projects and fifth rows. Or are you merely here to follow the curriculum and still enjoy free time (a rarity for the more active SUTD students) outside of school. 

I have many friends that spend a majority of their weekends in hostel, going back home only a few times per term. Not only is the school load not easy, but they take up numerous projects and other commitments. Through this, they have excelled far beyond their peers because of the amount of time dedicated to learning (academics and technical skills). But this path really isn't for everyone. You have to make a choice.

If you arent going to take the opportunities that SUTD has in terms of projects and skills development, then it certainly isn't worth it coming to a school that far away."

ThumbsUpMan117,1,"GLP is usually during your 1st summer after term 3. Most GLP things aren't graded but you can take a HASS mod in certain schools that can map back to SUTD which can count to your GPA/fulfill HASS requirement. 

GEXP is during term 6 and is graded. You have to do 3 pillar + 1 HASS mods in the host uni but it's all pass/fail. The pillar mods taken have to map to one of the mods offered by SUTD.

As to reqs idk if theres been any changes but from what I rmb its; (this is non-exhaustive)
GPA >= 4.0
No Bootcamp
No fails
Fifth row leadership roles

Whether you actually get selected really depends on your GPA and how much you've actually done in terms of side projects/fifth row. Like the really popular schools (Berkeley/Stanford for GLP and Waterloo for GEXP) usually goes to the students that are like GPA 4.5 and above kind. I'd suggest you put alot of effort into freshmore year cos that's the easiest time to get a good GPA/do side projects/fifth row."

You can have late night karaoke with the roomie, mahjong at midnight, htht with friends... I regret not having as much fun as I could have, though I admit I really need my sleep too haha cos that’s the only chance to really recharge :”) introvert problems oh well

Bring magiclean or something and keep your room clean. Rinse the fan cover at the start of every term. Keeping my room clean helped me feel a lot better (especially looking at the clean, white fan instead of a dusty, grey one), and was one less distraction from studying, particularly the night before an exam LOL And oh ya you need to bring your own trash bin!! Also you can ask the cleaning staff to lend you their vacuum cleaner on the day of check-in (very useful for cleaning the fan), but after that I’ve never tried.

Always bring your room card along with you. Be a considerate resident and don’t leave leftover food in the sink/microwave (ie clear up after yourself), because that can and will attract pests.

I think Fifth Rows have more “perks” than Interest Groups, but I’m not entirely sure about that.

All Fifth Rows start off as Interest Groups (or at least since this thing came about), and you’ll have to pass a bunch of requirements to become a Fifth Row, else they stay as an Interest Group (which isn’t necessarily a bad thing, some of them do want to stay as Interest Groups). SUTD Sketchers is an example of an Interest Group that has stayed as an Interest Group. Either way there is paperwork to be done.

I think in your case you’d go to OSL to talk about it, since you’re heading in the direction of Fifth Row rather than a one-off non-Fifth Row student-initiated event/activity? Of course, I could be wrong. Hope to see your idea become reality next year!!"

2nd question: It's really what you make of it. Some people consistently sleep at 11 and wake up at 6, others get together and drink until the wee hours. We do have hostel events from time to time, but they're not quite compulsory, just sign up if you're interested, they're all free anyway so go and have fun! Keeping your hostel slot is not as stressful as in NUS though, we don't have Hall CCAs or anything (our population is too small for that), you just need to avoid breaking the rules, participate in at least one hostel event a term, and live far enough from school. Strict rules, technically yeah there are a few, but just don't get caught and you'll be fine. Oh, and don't be a nuisance either, be a considerate resident. Sleep is really precious here lol

3rd question: Not exactly, you can refer to the freshmen welcome guide for some guidelines (they'll email it to you after you accept the offer). Other than that, you'd want to look out for a decent CPU (Intel i5 or better), a dedicated graphics card, sufficient memory (minimum 8GB RAM), and sufficient storage (256GB SSD for programs (128GB not enough if you want all your programs on the SSD, source: me :D), top up with dual/cloud/external storage if you need more, but never less). Also a 13"" screen minimum, else coding would be pretty uncomfortable. Portability would be really nice too (but it may get really pricey depending on how much you push for the aforementioned specs), but power sockets are quite readily available in classrooms if that's a concern. [You can also find more insights from seniors in this thread.](https://www.reddit.com/r/sutd/comments/8dy7cn/regarding_laptops_for_uni/)"
is_a_act,1,"1. They exist. That's about all the info I have on this, sorry. 
2. I've always seen hostel just as a place to sleep. When I was staying in hostel typically I'd work in school for most of the day and come back, shower, chill, and sleep. To me most of my social life didn't revolve around hostel life. I'm going to guess you're referring to enforcement of rules, and it varies. Most rules aren't strictly enforced unless you're causing a disruption or there's an increase in it happening. The worst I've ever heard is when security went into someone's room because they smelt alcohol but there was a huge uproar over it and I don't think it's going to happen again. (That said one thing I don't think people know is that consumption of alcohol is what is not allowed. Having it in your room is just fine, I've walked past the guards carrying bottles of vodka before.) TLDR: usually no. but read the rules and know your rights. 
3. I'm using a laptop with a 4th gen intel cpu. Currently the market is on what, 8th gen? Get a laptop with keyboard, screen, ergonomics that you like (NB: I'm in ESD, I think android studio is... less forgiving?). If you need to train ML models chances are, labs are open to you. I believe there's a server somewhere with Tesla GPUs that you can access with jupyter notebooks, though I've tried accessing it and it's a little inconvenient but way better for your wallet. (That said if you're going to be 3d printing a lot get a computer with a SD card reader.)"
is_a_act,3,"They're the school's property technically, so it's unlikely you'll see them on the internet. It's possible some profs won't mind (or notice) if you drop in on a lecture, though..."

ThumbsUpMan117,7,"You get assigned to a class of like 50 other students. You stay with this same class for every mod throughout year 1. It's way easier to make friends like this compared to NUS/NTU which doesnt do this. Your hostel rooms are also allocated to put you in closer proximity to your classmates. The school cohort is also pretty small. You'll probably know at least 2/3 of your cohort by the end of your 3.5 years. Why is knowing people important? Probably cos we do alot of project work and working with people you know is wayyyyyyyy better than working with randos. It also helps if your asking for help with coursework. Prof Grace Dixon will tell you that Networks == Power  


Also, the insane number of projects really preps you for the working world where the problems are kinda vague and there's no texkbook solution and no one to hold your hand.   


Only downside is that admin kinda sucks and there aren't alot of funds lying around the sch"
huikang,7,"I have written about reasons NOT to some time ago:

>The following are serious reasons not to join SUTD.  
>  
>**University education is not your central focus of your undergraduate years.** The SUTD curriculum requires your commitment. You will be involved with at least one group project (1D project) for each course, and one group project that involves all courses (2D project) taken in the same term. If you are already running a startup full-time and you could only afford 10 hours a week it is better you choose other universities and take only one to three courses per term.  
>  
>**Pure research is your dream.** In SUTD we emphasise on design. These means that we are focused on prototyping products that can have a real impact on the end user. If you want to be a pure mathematician or theoretical physicist, you cannot get the necessary foundation from the courses here.  
>  
>The following are less important reasons that you find a compromise for:  
>  
>**You are a competitive programmer/sportsperson.** As SUTD focuses on a multi-disciplinary approach to education and as a small university, you are likely not to find peers that participate in the competition at your level. You are more likely to find such peers in NUS/NTU.  
>  
>**You want great flexibility for your curriculum.** As a small university many of our courses are not available in some terms of the year. You may experience difficulty taking an unusual combination of courses due to prerequisites and unavailability.  
>  
>**You have zero interest in humanities.** For almost all the academic terms you are required to take a humanities subject. This is a downside if you insist that time is better spent on your specialisation.

HypothesisTesting,2,"Same like jc/poly, it depends on your timetable luck, but mostly there are five days of lessons a week. (In pillar you can choose your own timetable, and it is possible to have a shorter week.) There will be makeup classes, just like other unis, if there happens to be a public holiday during the week, although, at least for freshmore, we're pretty lucky in that we don't have makeup lessons during the weekend (or at least I've never heard of it). Though it may screw up the rest of the week, for example, this CNY, we missed Tuesday and Wednesday, so my Friday was an 0830–1800 affair with 4 x 30 min breaks in between :"") [It is still a possibility, however](https://www.sutd.edu.sg/academic_calendar-aspx), and I am also unable to comment on pillar years.

Earliest lesson possible starts at 0830, and freshmore lessons end latest by 1800. Lessons allocated at night, yes there are such slots and I think they were introduced this term, but they're restricted to pillar years I believe."

HypothesisTesting,7,"We had a fruit battery project for Intro to Physical Chem a few weeks back. They gave instructions and some limitations, but of course there were still vague parts (read: possible loopholes), so some people wanted some clarification about whether they could do the thing they wanted to do. The profs sent an FAQ via email, and the following are some of my favourites:

* (2) can we dump the fruit in brine/lemon juice before and/or during the expt? *The fruit will remain a fruit. It is not to become a preserved fruit*
* (4) can we boil the fruit? *No, it is to remain as fresh fruit*
* (5) Can you split the fruit in anyway? Use muscle power, bite it, ... *No*
   * For some context, points are given out by the formula: 0.5 x voltage of LED used x (10 - amount of money spent on materials). We had to 'purchase' the materials through the worksheet (including the LED), which the school would then provide. They realised students would want to split the fruits to get the most bang for their buck, and so ""Please DO NOT cut any item"" was stated on the brief. They specifically used the word ""cut"". Obviously they were asking for trouble :D
* (9)Can I inject H+ or H2O2 into the fruit? *No. This is not a research project. We are hoping you can do back-of the envelope calculation and understand that there is optimization and limitation in any design*
* (16) Can I bring things to the activity? *Please use the items provided. Only bring yourself and your groupmates*

Upon reading that email, I really felt that I had made the right choice to come to SUTD. Other than that, other things I can think of, in no particular order:

* Collaboration, rather than competition, is emphasised. Sharing is caring yo
* More projects, more hands-on experiences
* In projects, there may be competitive elements (such as F1 racing for EPD juniors yesterday, take a look at the SUTD insta! really cool stuff), but done right, it adds to the fun. Also, watching the juniors stay up for the previous two nights and testing their robots on the track made my heart feel warm in a way hahaha
* Stay up til dawn for design
   * For real though, design was a pain but being able to build a physical thing to solve a problem of your choosing was fun, as were the memories of the silly things people did to get their hands on stuff or to build stuff, such a lugging a discarded shelf from the fablab scrapyard all the way to class to salvage for parts
* Huge variety of Fifth Rows, and usually not having to get past auditions to join, so you can try new things more easily
* People are generally friendly and willing to help one another out. That said, ""treat others how you want to be treated"".
* You're thrown into cohorts in freshmore so instead of suffering alone, you suffer with others :D
* This is not very explicit, but I feel that taking one's initiative to do/start things is very strongly encouraged. Be a do-er, rather than a dreamer
* No need to fight to get on a shuttle bus to grab lunch (or to go anywhere else in school for that matter); at least one fully-sheltered path to and from every building around (and most importantly imo, from school to hostel)"

HypothesisTesting,2,"Hello! For ESD, [""An estimate of 10% – 14% of our ESD graduates have joined both local and overseas universities to pursue their graduate studies.""](https://esd.sutd.edu.sg/academics/undergraduate-programme/faq/) and [here are some examples of the institutions they go to](https://esd.sutd.edu.sg/academics/undergraduate-programme/advanced-studies/). Can't find info for ISTD and EPD, but you can email the admissions staff to ask! They'll definitely be willing to help."
huikang,2,"Firstly, congratulations! I look forward to your contributions to SUTD. To answer your queries:

Medical insurance is part of the compulsory miscellaneous fees, and I did get some free consultation and medicine in an affiliated clinic when I was sick. I think international students are also covered by medical insurance.

Year 1 (Freshmores) are given double-room housing allocation by default. All Freshmores enjoy the same price [https://www.sutd.edu.sg/Campus-Life/Housing/Undergraduate-(Freshmore)/Payment-AY2019](https://www.sutd.edu.sg/Campus-Life/Housing/Undergraduate-(Freshmore)/Payment-AY2019). In pillar years, housing prices are slightly higher, and allocation is not guaranteed especially for students who have a home near the school. Not breaking hostel rules, being a good roommate, and participation in some hostel activities organised increases your chances of securing hostel placement.

Unlike internships and job offers, as well as scholarship offers from corporations and the government, I do not think you have any liability if you withdraw before the school starts. However after you have started school, you may be liable to pay if you drop out of the programme. Ultimately, you have to refer to the contract. We also hope that you accept the offer only if you are very likely to matriculate in our school eventually."
mar_heave,2,"huikang is right.
also congratulations to you! that's a new and looks to be a very prestigious programme, I'm sure you will be busier than the already busy students at SUTD.
I'm an international student myself, and yes you get this amazing insurance by clinicflex NTUC income managed by Adept. Going to most clinics is free including consultation and medicine, except for certain medicine products. 
You will be covered for surgeries, specialist consultations in government restructured hospitals as well, but this one you have to pay first and then you submit a claim through CliniFlex App and they will reimburse you. there will be details they tell you in a lecture when you come about insurance, so keep an ear out.

As for housing fees, by the time you reach pillar years it's about SGD 2000 per term. assuming you're not using your scholarship allowance for food and stuff, you can pay your housing easily using that allowance.

But otherwise you can apply to become a House Guardian, like a housing committee of sorts, not too demanding but still some commitment is needed, and you will get priority for housing after Freshmore year, and there would be housing discounts up to 15%, but I heard they might reduce the discount.

Also, it's difficult to get cheaper housing outside of SUTD hostel once you finish Freshmore year. There's Changi Court just beside SUTD where indonesian students like to stay, but you can only get cheap (~SGD 400 per month) rates if you're lucky. 

Otherwise, SUTD Housing in pillar years is still considered cheap if you stay in the hostel most of the year. it's about SGD 5800 total for 12 months, so that's less than SGD 500 per month. But if you go home for 1-2 months total a year, then it's still less than SGD 600 per month which is not bad.

And as huikang noted, but I will add yes you can even attend school for 2 weeks, starting from the first official lesson week, and still withdraw and not pay penalty. I read somewhere that says it's 2 weeks after you start school you can still withdraw and disappear without paying anything. Withdrawing after 2 weeks you have to pay like SGD 30,000 penalty (unsubsidised tuition fee for one term)"

HypothesisTesting,4,"Hello and welcome to SUTD! :)

I cannot fully answer your question, but I can try to help make the waters a bit clearer! For the nitty gritty it'd be best to email the [Office of Student Administration](https://www.sutd.edu.sg/financialaid) (scroll down for the address). While typing this post out I agree there's quite a lot of information everywhere @.@

First off, I'm assuming you're a Singapore Citizen, and that you have indicated that you will be taking up the MOE Tuition Grant in your admission application. (Else, ""Students who are offered admission without the MOE Tuition Grant will not be eligible for Financial Aid throughout their entire course candidature."") There is no need to repay the Grant, nor is there a bond.

According to the [Tuition Fees](https://www.sutd.edu.sg/fees) page, fees will be *about* $7k (cos not updated for 2019 admission) per term after TG (assuming that you applied and were admitted in 2019, instead of an earlier year). Additionally, for the Freshmore hostel stay, it will be [$4,141.80, including utilities, excluding air-con](https://www.sutd.edu.sg/Campus-Life/Housing/Undergraduate-(Freshmore)/Payment-AY2019).

After that, the following financial aid (not scholarship) options are available (going in the order of disbursement of funds in [this document](https://www.sutd.edu.sg/SUTD/media/SUTD/Financial-Aid_20171128_(overview)-(Final).pdf)):

* [SUTD administered study/bursary awards](https://www.sutd.edu.sg/Admissions/Undergraduate/Financial/Financial-Aid/SUTD-administered-Study-Bursary-Awards) (tuition)
   * This will grant you $5-7k for a year, should you be granted one of the awards. This should be good for the first term.
   * May or may not have additional terms (but none demand monetary repayment), depending on the exact award
   * Need to reapply for subsequent years
* [GIC Sparks](https://www.sutd.edu.sg/Admissions/Undergraduate/Financial/Financial-Aid/Special-Programme-Grant/GIC-Sparks) (tuition)
   * This is a special programme, so do head over to the page to read more
   * This grants $6k per year, and you can get it a maximum of two times
   * No repayment, no bonds
   * Need to reapply subsequently
* [Post-Secondary Education Account](https://www.sutd.edu.sg/Admissions/Undergraduate/Financial/Financial-Aid/Post-Secondary-Education-Account) (tuition)
   * Can pay up to 100% of the balance
   * No repayment

* [Tuition Fee Loan](https://www.sutd.edu.sg/Admissions/Undergraduate/Fees-Financial-Matters/Financial-Aid/Tuition-Fee-Loan) (tuition)
   * ""Educational loan administered by one of the local banks""
   * Loan amount is ""up to 90% of the subsidised tuition fees payable by full-time SC undergraduates"". The loan is interest-free while you are in the course.
   * Repayment to the bank
   * You can find the instructions for application on [the same page](https://www.sutd.edu.sg/Admissions/Undergraduate/Fees-Financial-Matters/Financial-Aid/Tuition-Fee-Loan)
   * On the SEOG page, it is stated that ""*tuition fee loan may be taken up if the recipient chooses to use the CDC/CCC University Bursary and MOE Bursary towards living allowance only.*"" I don't know what this really means so do check with OSA!
* [Enhanced SUTD Education Opportunity Grant](https://www.sutd.edu.sg/Admissions/Undergraduate/Financial/Financial-Aid/Education-Opportunity-Grant/Enhanced-SUTD-Education-Opportunity-Grant) (tuition)
   * You will have to have applied for the CPF Education Scheme and/or Tuition Fee Loan to be eligible for this
   * In your case, this will grant you ""up to 25% of subsidised tuition fees"", so about $1,725 assuming tuition fees is exactly $7k per term. I can't tell if this is 25% per term or per year though.
   * No repayment, no bonds
   * Need to reapply for subsequent years
* [Kwai Fong and Raymond Goh — SUTD Education Opportunity Grant](https://www.sutd.edu.sg/Admissions/Undergraduate/Financial/Financial-Aid/Education-Opportunity-Grant/Kwai-Fong-and-Raymond-Goh-%E2%80%93-SUTD-Education-Opportu) (tuition)
   * You mentioned that your PCI is *about* $1.25k. If it's smaller than or equal to $1.2k, you can possibly look into this one too!
* [Study Loan Scheme](https://www.sutd.edu.sg/Admissions/Undergraduate/Financial/Financial-Aid/Study-Loan-Scheme) (tuition, and optionally living/study-related expenses)
   * You must be under the CPF Education Scheme and/or the Tuition Fee Loan to be eligible for this
   * Considering your PCI, you'll be under Scheme 2 for this. The scheme itself has two components:
      * (1) Tuition Fee Component: loan amount of ""up to 10% of the subsidised tuition fees payable by SCs""
      * (2) Living Allowance Loan: you may additionally opt to apply for a ""living allowance loan of $1,200; $2,400 or $3,600 per academic year""
   * The loan is interest-free while you are in the course
   * Repayment to the bank
   * You can find the instructions for application on [the same page](https://www.sutd.edu.sg/Admissions/Undergraduate/Financial/Financial-Aid/Study-Loan-Scheme)
* [MOE Bursary Scheme](https://www.sutd.edu.sg/Admissions/Undergraduate/Financial/Financial-Aid/Bursaries/MOE-Bursary-Scheme) (living/study-related expenses)
   * This will grant you $2.7k for a year
   * There are a bunch of points to note at the bottom, but the main points in your case would be that you cannot hold this bursary concurrently with another scholarship, study award/grant, or bursary, unless they are ""meant to cover the tuition fees only""
   * Need to reapply for subsequent years
   * Apply through MyPortal

In your case, you do not qualify for the [CDC/CCC-University Bursary](https://www.sutd.edu.sg/Admissions/Undergraduate/Fees-Financial-Matters/Fees-Financial-Matters-(1)/CDC-CCC-University-Bursary-Scheme) and the [Mendaki Tertiary Tuition Fee Subsidy](https://www.sutd.edu.sg/Admissions/Undergraduate/Fees-Financial-Matters/Financial-Aid/Mendaki-Tertiary-Tuition-Fee-Subsidy), but I'm linking them for anyone else who's reading.

ThumbsUpMan117,2,"1. Fifth Rows are basically CCAs. i've been in exco positions since freshmore to senior year in two different clubs  and AFAIK the school basically has no say over who gets elected exco in fifth rows but UA (university ambassador) and Root (student council) might have a different system. u/ryanndelion might have more info on that. so idk what the quoted text means and if it means they can just stick you in exco of whichever club you like then theres a bigger problem here that we should be worried about.
2. so there are currently few ways for overseas travel. summer exchanges, fall exchanges and STEP program. you probably should check with the school what is the exact name of the program quoted for ""overseas immersion trip"" as it sounds like something new in which i dont have the answers for.
3. i personally havent done a count myself but 20 design projects sounds about right. most of them in the freshmore year are pretty small scale lasting maybe about 1-2 weeks long. there are the 1D projects which are contained within the subject and 2D projects which span all 4 subjects you are taking. imo most of the projects in freshmore dont have real meaning if you aren't interested in that particular field. however, the stuff you do in design term, pillar year and finally capstone can be pretty big and should have real world applications. personally, i've included some of these projects in my own CV/portfolio.

hope this helps"

Intro to Bio will have lectures, but I haven't taken it yet so I'll get back to you in like a month? haha
2. Really depends on your time management skills, but when the projects are due, haha almost definitely not man. I'm in freshmore rn so idk how much this will hold true in pillar years though
3. Depends on your luck I guess. Term 1 was quite messy, Term 2 started at 9am every day, Term 3 pretty good in comparison despite two 8.30am classes. That aside, you get 5 hours of math, physics, chem/bio (for Term 1 and 3), programming (for Term 3) a week, 2 hours of HASS recitation (for Term 1 and 2), design I forgot but it'll be eating up way more than the allocated time anyway. Also, an hour of freshmore writing programme for half of Term 2!
4. Nope, but I don't know the details
5. Sorry I no answer hahaha"
is_a_act,1,"I can't answer the last 2 because I'm not in archi.

Depends on the module but usually no. Some students record lessons for this reason but it's not common.

>is it tough to handle my life commitment with the school cos more hands-on and project?

In a sense, yes. You definitely need more time because school demands more of you. But a lot of my interests now come from stuff that I learned as a side-project related to school, like web scraping or making a telegram bot. That said, bear in mind that archi students anywhere will find it tough to handle general lifestyle commitments because of how time-consuming the subject can be. 

I don't have copies of mine any more but expect 4-5 hours of classes a day, 3 pieces of homework a week? The curriculum has changed since I was a freshie though.

From what I can tell of SUTD ASD, it focuses a fair bit on parametric design. I'll let the ASD people talk about that, though.

tlkh,3,"Cross-posting my post that I made in SUTD family so I can also address this on Reddit.

But firstly, a bit of context. I'm not from ROOT. Neither do I believe ROOT is an effective organisation (sorry to the ROOT guys, I know you're trying but I'm just stating my personal opinion here and I'm not gonna lie about what my opinion is). I am also not representing any organisation in this post. However, I want to address a few things regarding ""townhall"" aka Dialogue with Senior Management (let's call it DSM cos I lazy type).

When DSM was conceptualised earlier this year, Qing Ze and I were part of that team, along with other various concerned students who stepped up, along with ROOT which also helped make the event a reality. While I'm not saying the current format of DSM is the perfect format and needs no improvement, we tried really hard to improve the effectiveness of the whole ""townhall"" thing. Many people's observations from previous townhall was that it was mainly students voicing out grievances and complaints. While that is ""true dialogue"" as the reddit poster might say, we identified two main problems with that format. Firstly, the questions might be confrontational or not well thought-out. Secondly, the senior management might not have the answer at hand. However, given the venue, they are pressured into giving an answer. And if no proper answer is given, the students feel that their concerns are being ignored, and the management probably feel that townhall has a tendency to evolve into some sort of debate or flaming match, and hence approach the event with a more defensive mindset. Neither of this is productive, and then everyone leaves the event salty and not bothering to follow up

So this is how we tried to do this. We proposed to ROOT to make full use of their (regular?) GRASS sessions to be that event where students can, unfiltered, voice out any comments, feedback, opinions, instead of having that during townhall. From the GRASS events (or from students that approach ROOT directly with complaints), we identify if any of these concerns brought up can be organised into broader ""themes"", as well as try to see if we can identify stakeholders, root causes and possible solutions. Before the DSM event, we approach the relevant staff/faculty/management with what we have collected. This allows the relevant whoever some time and space to be able to investigate the issue on their side and be able to present a proper answer, or better yet, whether they have considered any solutions. On our side, we make best effort to continuously follow up to ensure that questions are being answered. During the DSM event we will present what has transpired and the management/staff will present their answers to the student population.

We also have that Q&A session in DSM to see if there are any sudden burning questions, especially arising from the content discussed during the current DSM. However, that is not the focus of DSM (something like that is catered for in GRASS or one of the other feedback channels). Let me assure you that feedback collected through GRASS for example is not solely processed by ROOT, and that there are other concerned students who will make sure that feedback is not magically forgotten by ROOT or the rest of the people organising DSM.

Sometimes, the answer we get in DSM is not something we students want to hear. The sad truth is that we're not going to get everything we want. And usually the ball is out of our court anyway since it's probably some policy or decision by some dude with rank. But what we did do is to make an absolute best effort to get that answer, and make the relevant parties absolutely aware of our concerns, so that at very least they can give a better answer why they said no to something. At very least, we didn't do poorer than if we did nothing, but in some cases we did manage to make things happen (my memory is poor but I believe we have a proper record somewhere), or at least make the other parties more understanding of the priorities of students vs their own, and encourage them to involve students much more heavily in decision making processes.

So that is all I have to say, and frankly I think during the first DSM we tried very hard to explain why we ""designed"" DSM this way, to the point where feedback given to us was ""just get to the point next time"". Seeing the reddit post makes me feel that we did not do a good enough job to explain the concept of DSM, and I got really triggered, so I hope this post can clear some things up.

Lastly, a call for action. If you're not happy with something, do something about it (in addition to bitching anonymously). There is no need to wait for ROOT, or any other student organisation or group to take action."

oneofus-oneofus,4,"1) Despite my personal opinions to this question, I think people should be aware that there is limited information in terms of solid evidence. However, do expect it to be hard to get a 1st class or even 2nd upper equivalent. The only 'fact' I can provide is that subjects can only give a maximum of 20% of students an 'A' grade (starting from A minus), and that professors may try to argue for a higher percentage, but they may not succeed. Irrespective of grading, the employment statistics (disregarding what they actually refer to, because you would not know unless you gather it) seem to be not too bad.

Also, as you mentioned you interested in going to ISTD, GPA is a terrible indicator of technical skills in ISTD even as parochial companies use it to screen applicants.

2) What do you mean by 'a lot' and by 'there?' If you mean SUTD in general, there is a hard cap that SUTD has to abide to for foreigner-local student ratio. The SM2 scholars are only not allowed to take ASD. I think what is important is to consider not just SM2 students, but that the general distribution of students (inclusive of local students) in each pillar change from year to year, which would change your student experience.

3) According to official answers, no. However, I would note that fully-paid opportunities only live in the past. I do not know of any such equivalent fully-paid overseas opportunity now. However, there is still some subsidy.

4) By competitive, do you mean that there is a competitive team, or that SUTD boasts a highly competitive team which can win in the inter-varsity games? While I think SUTD's sports teams are improving, I think it is difficult for a small university to compete as well as the other universities overall. It is possible to have practical reasons to have a CCA, usually in terms of 'leadership' positions so that you can talk about your 'leadership' qualities or actions. In any case, I would caution against treating CCAs as being ""only detrimental to my studies"" because most of undergraduate studies mean little with regard to general life. (and you are unlikely to be that special exception)

5) No. Clique formation is common, but I do not have anecdotal or numeric evidence to compare this against the other universities.

6) You mentioned food but not bureaucracy. Do not expect any place in Singapore to not suffer from bureaucracy."
is_a_act,1,"> 1) The grading system was changed (correct me if I'm wrong) and it's apparently harder to get a good GPA. Will this affect my chances of getting a job after I graduate? (Sorry if it's a stupid question)

It's not a stupid question. I can't answer you reliably on this though I imagine you will not like the answer. 

> 2) Are there a lot of PRC students in SUTD?

""a lot"" is relative. 5-10% in my class? To varying degrees of naturalisation.

3) With the end of the SUTD-MIT collaboration, will there be less overseas opportunities?

No, they're trying to partner more places now. That said, funding and subsidies have been becoming less common.

> 4) Are the Fifth row activities purely casual or do you have a competitive team? Is there any practical reason to have a CCA or will they only be detrimental to my studies? (Edit)

Both exist. Some clubs are solely competitive some are solely casual. re: practical reasons, social life, discounts for the thing you like since you have the numbers to ask for them, access to funding if you're lucky.

> 5) Are majority of the students unsociable/nerdy?

I don't think so. Some people definitely are quieter but it's just like any ~~non-business~~ uni; each class will have its share of quiet ones and jokers. 

> 6) Any things you dislike about the school other than the horrible food? (In any aspect)

I say this to everyone: new school problems. Protocols aren't established yet, which makes some things messy. A certain office which I'm not going to complain about here give the impression that they don't care about you. (emailed them about something, they did the work on their part but never got back to me to let me know I could do my side of things.) Notes are confusing and not the best sometimes. These are things that other schools got to solve with repeated iterations - policies for responding to emails, notes get annotated and refined, all that. That said they're still real problems that you'll have to live with. If you want to make a difference, get to know the staff. Work with them and understand their system before offering improvements. I've heard that OSL is in need of a better (more user friendly) database management system."

floodvalve,6,"What pillar are you intending to join, and what kind of workflow are you looking at? There are lots of different setups I've seen and it depends how you do work best. Do you think you'd spend a lot of time at your desk, or would you rather be mobile and work in different places?

ASD: You might want to go for a Windows desktop + Mac/Windows laptop setup, work is mostly done on Rhino and Adobe Suite (Ps, Ai, etc.). Renders are computationally heavy, and can be done on laptops, but it isn't the fastest. The school also provides iMacs and desktops for use. In this case then you can go for a smaller screen size for portability.

EPD: 3D modelling/simulations are probably your concern, but I think most laptops should be able to get the job done, just not in the fastest way.

ESD/ISTD: Matter of preference. If I were to start again I'd probably do Windows desktop + Linux/Windows dual boot laptop. ML training probably won't be done by your laptop, at the very least on your desktop with a good GPU. Most people just choose to run training on the cloud. The school also has computing resources if you're doing undergraduate research, so no worries. Desktop is optional but it's handy for ML/CAD/Adobe stuff in general.

My personal preference is getting something small and portable for classes & assignments and having a beastly workstation somewhere else for games and computationally heavy tasks (Try building the desktop yourself!). Other setups I've seen include iPad Minis + Macbooks, Surface Pros + Desktops, etc. Still, said desktop does not exist for me yet and I've got by 5 terms with only an i7-6500U so far. Might build one soon though."
hornhound-,3,"Hi! Regarding size, it really is up to you, since everyone has different preferences. Personally, I don't really mind a smaller screen and would take the smaller size because it's lighter and more convenient, so I would go for 13"". But many other people would want to have a larger screen, so it's definitely a matter of preference. 

For the processor, I think a better processor is mostly just a bonus, though it would be an especially good bonus if you are thinking of going for ASD or machine learning/AI in ISTD, as rendering for ASD and computations for ML/AI are quite CPU intensive, so you might save some time for those if you have a better CPU. Otherwise, I think that the difference is not too significant. 

You can definitely get away without having Windows. I'm a Windows user myself, but have had classmates who use MacOS and Ubuntu, so I believe it should be fine. I think not having a lot of local storage space should be fairly alright, so long as you don't end up installing too many programs that you don't actually use much. I've never used a Macbook before so I cant really comment too much about whether your Macbook Air would be good enough.

With all that being said, if you do end up purchasing a new laptop, I would recommend that you get one with a SSD. You might have to pay a little extra for it, but I think the increase in speed that it brings is definitely worth it."

ryanndelion,3,"I'll answer first I guess!

1.  The biggest change was the environment. I'm from a different country so the juxtaposition of maker culture and mugger culture was... interesting. People in SUTD do wayyy too much stuff, which is good but it can be daunting for a new student.

2.  Spoiler alert: you don't! But in all seriousness, I think SUTD is as busy as you want it to be. If you take initiative and do more stuff around school, you're gonna be sleeping 4 hrs a day max (also if you're an archi student you get 4 hrs max regardless). But if you kinda just go thru the courses one could subsist on 6-8 hours a day (obviously this is a huge generalization but it's just my experience).

3.  My favorite part of SUTD is probably the amount of opportunities one gets, regardless of gpa or past achievements. It's very easy to get an overseas exchange or research project, which is rare in other schools.

4. The worst things in school boil down to bureaucracy and food. Sutd is kinda bogged down with a lot of red tape and unnecessary roadblocks, which is expected in singapore but annoying for a school that touts it's 'american' culture. Canteen food is also absolute gobshite but lovepal cafe (in hostel) has a decent japanese menu.

5. Memes, Math and Meetings.

kohjingyu,3,"1. Probably the autonomy you get. There are significantly less rules at a university, so you really do whatever you want (of course, you have to bear the consequences as well).
2. I'm in ISTD, so I think the workload is relatively manageable. I average 7.5 hours per night which is above average I think.
3. My favourite part is how open people are to helping each other - especially the faculty here. Most of the professors in SUTD are very friendly and have really cool projects happening that they are more than happy to involve you on.
4. As others have mentioned, probably the bureaucracy.
5. Eat. Code. Sleep."
oneofus-oneofus,2,"My take on OP's questions

* SUTD is a university, and being late is a lot more common. This is all about adult-ing and deciding what is important for yourself, but I think there's still room for people to be more punctual and not sacrifice anything else.
* In Freshmore, there will be this mod called Design which should take some nights away. Pillar years really depend on pillar, because ESD/ISTD have far more room for things instantly working because of talent or prior experience. EPD/ASD, which build more physical things, get less sleep.
* My favourite part of SUTD is that it is not any other universities; in particular, it is not NUS or NTU. NUS and NTU have developed to become really odd institutions which attract researchers who cannot teach (and are usually unwilling to), min-maxers who could not care about anything but GPA and generally people with no qualms regarding the flawed education system.
* There is bureaucracy in SUTD, like any other Singaporean university. I think the worst offenders are Housing and Career Development. The former imposes flawed rules with flawed implementation (e.g. security - there is a difference between being serious about security and serious about checklists). The latter is fairly inflexible especially regarding the compulsory internship which unsurprisingly is also about checklists rather than actual student exposure or experience.
* Challenging - Small - Projects

is_a_act,2,"> What was the biggest change when you first came to SUTD, from your previous educational institution?

There was a spirit of doing things - people wouldn't just think about stuff, but rather, flesh them out and execute stuff. Not quite from start to finish i.e. without marketing it and showing it off, but I think that's just because people hope that if their project really shines, people will take note and word will spread naturally.

> How do you cope with the workload? (How much sleep do you get each night?)

I'm in ESD, known to be one of the easier pillars. In Freshmore term I wouldn't get much sleep because I overcommitted - literally would forget to eat. Back then, once week 4 starts, maybe 5-6 hours of sleep. Now that only happens around week 11 (last week) where I get maybe 4.5 hours if I'm unlucky, though some days i get 7.5. 

> What's your favourite part of SUTD?

The marketing draws in people who enjoy doing things. There's also a lot of interesting people and things that can give you inspiration. Also, very cross-disciplinary. 

> Is there anything you really dislike about SUTD, and why?

Small-m management is (currently) very top-down and students need to fight tooth and nail to get stuff done because of red tape. There are a lot of initiatives to have students' voice heard, and I'm optimistic that it'll change. It's partly a problem of being a new school - we don't have as much protocol in place. 

> Which three words would you choose to describe your student experience in SUTD so far?

This one's tough. 
Different. 
Beautiful.
Marketing 101. "
Meepmerp96,1,No
amandarl33,1,Maybe?
is_a_act,1,"Of course it is, what the heck. As far as I'm aware of, SUTD isn't interviewing people just so it can make sure the students they accept are uniformly distributed in their ability (NB: ability, not grades). They obviously want the best. How is that not elitism? 

Maybe you're following the definition of elitism that deems it necessarily something bad. ""the superior attitude or behaviour associated with an elite."", google tells me. That's up to us (students and faculty) to decide. I see a bit of it, definitely, but I see many of the same people willing to teach or at the very least direct people towards resources to learn. There's some of it, no doubt, and that's something I've hated about the school, but it's a minority."
oneofus-oneofus,1,"> When will the underground link way between the school and the MRT station open?

So this. Will it open during this term or the next term? Construction works seem to have already started."
oneofus-oneofus,5,"The 75 million is probably budgeted for a period of five years at least. But much of it probably is targeted towards 'lifelong education.'

Higher Education policy is directed by the Ministry, but such funding decisions are probably decided by the Board. None of the students and/or the middle management would likely know of the exact scale of which dollars go where.

To speculate, I would guess the Ministry said something and the Board decided to change something. Plausible reasons range from funding being deemed unsustainable of any kind or perhaps as further fallout from the now-not-very-alive MIT collaboration.

In any case, it is generally true for undergraduates in Singapore (but this also applies elsewhere) to never receive the bulk of the funds. University funds in Singapore are expected to go to research (i.e. a few professors and their projects, if they are awarded X grant) and research is hardly done by undergraduates."

is_a_act,4,"This is kind of a pet peeve than something super big but in any case it affects visitors a lot more than it affects us. 

The signage in school is laughably bad?? Like at either building 1/2 if you look at the signs on the other side of the building (e.g. looking at the think tanks/capstone conference room from the cohort classrooms) they aren't even aligned across the different floors.

Not to mention they're misleading and probably get more people lost than to their destination. The things written on them aren't really there.

ktrjkloo,4,"2 more to the end of my shift, time to patrol.

Walking around school in a fixed path like i've got no control. 

Past the pavilion, past the canteen.

I always see you standing there, on the stairwell, you lean.

Covered from head to toe with all those marks,

nobody cleans you up, no one gives no fucks.

Done with my round, back to my station,

but I can't stop thinking of you, I can't stop this sensation.

Again and again I walk past you but do nothing.

Oh what can i do to alleviate your suffering?

My shift is over, its time to go home.

But i got to do something, I cant leave you alone.

Arggghhhh i can't take it anymore.

Im going to do what no security has done before.

Duster in my hand, i rubbed you clean.

Let your pearly whites, your bare body be seen.

There you stood, naked and shy.

My cheeks blushed, my heart rate rose, oh so high.

As i laid my hands on your sliky smooth skin,

blood rushed to my groins, my dick turned as hard as tin.

Time flew by as we stood there, gazing into each other's eyes.

I think I have fallen for you, but that realisation came as no surprise.

Hours, minutes, time passed us by.

Its already 6am, its time to say goodbye.

BUT NO! I can't!

We were meant to be, you shall no longer be shunned!

Let us run away!

Let us live a new life, live another day!

As i took you by the hand, 

we broke free! into the sunrise we ran!

A new life of whiteboard and man.

I can't wait for whats in store, what we've got planned.

ryanndelion,1,"We will be checking with facilities to find out who took our beloved whiteboard. But I think for issues like offensive terms that are written on the board, we as a student body really need to take the prerogative to keep it in check. Think about the management's perspective for a second - a visitor to the uni might go for lunch and see a massive dick/well-drawn pornhub logo on a whiteboard, open for all to see. That's just not very nice. Maybe try to check the board more often and remove any overtly offensive terms so that we can continue enjoying the whiteboards!"
lolsutd,2,"More people actually make things in their spare time (more passionate people), more helpful people, less bullshit people, less emphasis on CCAs/hostel activity whoring.

Crappier food, more restrictive and bullshit school admin, less social aspect.

Probably lots more, this is just off the top of my head"
iamasutdent,2,"People over here tend to be more wiling to push boundaries, and this is the population in general. Not like in the other universities where it is more likely small pockets of people. Find it ironic that other places they're laxer and yet innovation still does not happen. 

The experience in SUTD is one that is very close knit and you'll probably get to know everyone at least in your year before you graduate. 

We do have crappy food in our canteen, but who's complaining when alternatives are so readily available. Our campus is so compact that we don't even need shuttle buses, and our campus is very well designed. 

Hostel is alright but regulations are a bitch. Administration loves to play the devil and quash whatever crazy idea we have. Our curriculum is almost wholesale MIT so definitely very challenging. Career prospects very good for a very young school. 

No question its a young school, and we're still learning as we go along what we want as a school. I believe the school was found with the intent of creating a new generation of start-ups and entrepreneurs. If not why build a new school from the ground up where it is easier to just adjust what we have now. I don't think we have achieved that as much as a government wanted, but at least the school nurtured risk takers and boundary pushers. "

benedictsee,5,"Hi, thank you for your input. You have stated a few observations and I will address each observation accordingly.

1) ROOT’s engagement with students seem to be stuck at tokenism

Firstly, ROOT's major role has always been to be a voice of the students, as well as the critical bridge between the student body and administration. We have and are still trying our very best to reach out to students through several avenues such as Grass Sessions and even this Reddit page. We are also students like you, we pretty much experience the same things and said problems. The reason we joined ROOT in the first place is cause we want to improve our lives in school. Many have been working really hard behind the scenes for the betterment for all of us. Students asked for the power points in the canteen to be activated. ROOT delivered. Students asked for more study spaces like classrooms to be opened up. ROOT delivered. Students asked for faster Wi-Fi speed. ROOT delivered. We always take each feedback seriously as we are your friends. 

With regards to the housing policy, it is drafted in collaboration between the house guardians and housing after careful deliberation.

2) The black box in which the government operates in does not allow for collaboration between the students, the government and the administration.

ROOT has always been willing to answer any questions and aid in any way if approached. We do not operate in secrecy if that is your concern. 

Also, we are currently working on the ROOT website where all SAC minutes will be made available to anyone interested in reading them. SAC meetings are also opened for anyone to attend.

3) The streak of having the role of president being run unopposed is something the student government should look into.

First of all, it is not accurate to say that the election is ""unopposed"". The running party must first get a 75% internal vote of confidence in ROOT. After that, it must obtain at least a 20% approval rate from the student population. There is no walkover. 

There is much talk about having only one candidate, but the election works in such a way that the number of candidates is determined by the number of people that are willing to sign up in the first place. 

Yes, I completely agree that the role of the student government is central to the lives of the students it seeks to serve. We have already recognised this fact and are currently working on it. Do not fret as we are already doing our absolute best to help SUTD be a better place for all of us."
chay-,5,"Don’t overthink or overcomplicate things. I doubt the senior management or Root ever desires to assert bureaucracy or hide anything from the student population.

From your post and replies in this thread I can see two general things that you are concerned about. 1 is the apparent lack of progress despite the appearance of dedication and hard work by Root and 2 is the apparent lack of transparency.

Let’s talk about 1 first. You can broadly categorise the work that they do into proactive and routine work. 

Events team diligently organise their events. SI diligently aids in pitching and all the club matters. These are routine things that busies more than half the team, more than half the time. Within these routine, specialist duties, Root can potentially influence change by identifying processes that are repetitive or redundant, propose them, and get them rectified. 

But part of this process is to first experience the workflow, understand their rationale before they can identify the flaws and propose changes. It takes a lot of time and effort to build this degree of familiarity with the system.

For the proactive arm, they have a much wider scope to build familiarity with, especially in the aspect of student life. You cannot build a convincing case for change if you don’t first seek to understand the rationale of the current system. Engaging in conversation with all the stakeholders take a lot of time, and often through these conversations there are revelations that builds up maturity within Root.

And here’s the biggest thing. Root does succeeds in inciting change often, but it’s usually in the form of covering the management’s blind spots. And these lads don’t go around spreading success stories most of the time because it’s tantamount to criticising the school for their shortsightedness, which isn’t very nice. Why does it seem like they aren’t doing much? We all tend to focus on what isn’t going well, but easily forget about what is working just fine.

2. I’m irked and amused at the same time by the strong words you use. It takes time to build a healthy trusting relationship with the school, and it is fortunate that Root has such a strong relationship with them right now! One of the perks of such a relationship is access to privileged information, but with it comes with the responsibility to not spread it around and to help the management look out for potential blind spots.

Here let me give you an example of so-called ‘sensitive information’ that Root has access to sometimes. Projection of club budget figures and freshmore intake numbers, development plans for new labs and new pedagogy styles. These are things that have yet to happen and nothing is confirmed when Root is brought in to give their opinions on things.

Now, Root is like the alpha developers who sees all the stupid shit and good ideas. There is an unwritten obligation to keep their big mouths shut when they are handed these privileged information, partly because nothing is set in stone, and partly because most of these stupid shit will not happen in the end anyway and spreading them around and allowing students to turn rumours into facts is possibly the worst fear-mongering idea ever.

But when some of these things do eventually happen (and often get criticised), Root is in a position where they already understand the school’s rationale as well as being on the ground to collate the feedback from students. They are in the best position to facilitate discussions and close the feedback loop.

I don’t think it’s fair to criticise Root for not being transparent with what they know, because knowing how to keep your mouth shut is a basic rule of engagement. Amongst all the universities, the SUTD student leaders have the closest relationships with the management and it is largely attributed to this trust they have built over the years.

Keep this in mind: the last thing you want is for Root to have an antagonistic relationship with the school. This will unintentionally encourage the management to act independently without consulting any students. You won’t want that to happen.

There are many things that Root can improve on, and by all means you should keep the criticism flowing. But please don’t stop there. Benedict has heard and will keep hearing the same criticisms during his term as President, and what will truly help is if everyone seeks to understand the situation, attempt the process of generating a solution, and share your ideas."
elusivebanana,3,"Maybe I can give my two cents as a Freshmore in Root.

I think a good place to start is that no one that I have worked with in Root so far does this for any recognition or fame(case in point, your post haha, among other criticisms that we get - perhaps for the grad certification at most?) - but for the most part I can tell you up front that it's been a thankless, fairly intensive sai kang job so far. And I didn't want to say this at first, but I personally do feel hurt that what we do could be reduced to tokenism. But yes, in many regards, that is true - and yes, we're working on it, as jaded an answer that is.

From the very start, (and this I know from my brother in the pro tempore student government and the 0th root in the pioneer batch), all we really are is a bunch of students trying to make life better for the rest, unsuccessful as we are. And to a large extent I don't think it would be fair to compare us to NUS or other universities, which have vastly more mature systems in place, not even considering the disparity in resources and manpower.

Every system that we have in place right now is homegrown and specific to SUTD, for example:

* our soon-to-be but seemingly never complete ROOT website

* my own communications and publications team with an average ping of ~~200ms~~ 2-3 days

* the fifth row governance and finance system


amongst other things, and many change on an annual basis, some even every couple months.

On top of that, multiple initiatives grow and die weekly - either met with red-tape or other external constraints. We feel the pain of defeat dude. In the 2 terms I've been here I've already experienced that 3 times. If we publicized everything we did that failed, got stonewalled, or got dragged into stasis, I think that 60% of of our theoretical minutes would comprise of it. But for the rest of the successful initiatives that ROOT sees (for example, the communal living enjoyed by my batch of Freshmores), I'm really, really glad someone before me endured the slog to make it happen.

As for the issues of transparency -  just ask us personally, or make another post on this thread. So far, I've had no issues telling my classmates what's up in ROOT, barring some stuff that we are planning which requires the element of surprise, or specific NDA stuff that we find out from meeting school officials.

Lastly, the position of SUTD president is open next year.

TL;DR It's no secret that ROOT screws up often. We're not entirely effective. We do our best for what we can. You're welcome to join the shit show.

sleepy-hollow,1,"Simei mccafe has gr9 coffee for $3, if you're okay with the ride there and back.

The problem is really that most traditional kopi stalls will brew a big batch and keep it on the hotplate for hours at a time, or else portion it out into plastic cups, add milk and leave it in the fridge. The coffee goes bad when that happens.

Any kopi stall with low turnover will have this same problem, unless they are brewing each cup to order (at that point you might as well go to gomgom or cake shop).

But yea if you want decent coffee every morning that doesn't taste like the auntie ran hot water through an ashtray and added condensed milk, you're better off keeping milk and instant coffee in your fridge..."
ryanndelion,8,"Great post, I wish this was the first ever post on this sub. :( 

In response to your questions:

1. Yes please do. The music board alone helped me find lots of great bands and some funny videos as well.
2. Maybe you could use a blackboard instead of a whiteboard. More artsy ;)
3. Movie suggestions! And book suggestions.
4. Free speech is imperative in a school like SUTD that claims to be a perfect blend between East and West. Freedom to speak out about issues is a basic human right. It is what democracy is founded on. It is the reason we have a student government - to bring the voice of the students to the management, so that the things that can be changed will be changed. The problem is that the management is falling into the pit of 'if I don't like it, no one can do it'. It is a dark and dangerous pit and if left unchecked, can cause a lot more harm than good. The problem with giving absolute free speech is that you have people who like to shitpost. You have people who troll. And sometimes it's hard to separate them from those who actually want to add something meaningful to any conversation. That's why we have a subreddit! So that the good comments will rise to the top and the bad ones will be kept out of sight. Another problem then arises. Who decides what is good and what is not? Is the individual who upvotes or downvotes a post not influenced by the subreddits he visits, or by the news channel he watches? I would upvote an shitpost like the one recently posted here, simply because I find it ironically hilarious. But many others won't. I guess my point here is that freedom of speech works in an objectively defined world, where prejudices are untainted by one's upbringing, or love for deep-friend memes. That is not the world we live in. The best we can hope for is that people learn to be critical of ideas and objectively judge them without prejudice. Maybe then we can have a proper whiteboard conversation without interference."

There is no contention, you should.

SUTD claims to be a lot of things (and it is, don't get me wrong), but when you throw terms like *better world by design* / *be the change you want to see* around, you'd expect everyone -
 the staff, the management, the faculty and **even the students** - to be a little more progressive. The main exhibits around school aren't student or faculty projects - they're marketing material.


As much as we want to believe this is part of a bigger problem we can't do much about - we do what we can, even if it's the smallest of efforts, you're giving people ideas. Ideas turn to conversations, conversations shape culture, culture becomes identity, etc.


We came here buying into the ideals of collaboration, change, and to quote a friend, ""hacker culture and memes"". To be honest, we're investing the best years of our lives here and we don't have to wait till we graduate to *be the change*.


With all that said, well done /u/ktrjkloo, this was a really awesome job."
