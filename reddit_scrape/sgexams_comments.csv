boosheeet88,77,Respect to your hustle :) Personally I won't judge and instead will admire your dedication. There are many different paths leading to the same goal. Personally I like talking to older people as they have more experience than me and may be more mature. All the best!
Another_throwaway_03,26,"Nope, there were some exchangers in my rc and one of them was like 28. He still interacted very well with everyone and honestly no one knows if you don’t say or make it your personality like I wouldn’t know he was 28 if I didn’t ask."
JoshyJoshyJosh,6,I'm 27 in year 2 SMU and it's pretty okay for me!
Madrigal_io,5,"I had a junior in RC who had signed on for 5 years before coming to uni and was older than me. He'd talk about his life experiences with our corridor mates, and was one of the most friendly and genuine people I've ever met. 

Age matters little."
baktao,9,"If you're a guy, I found that girls tend to like the older guys. Happened in Poly and Uni. Haha."
throwawaykke,3,"Nahh it's common to see older students. I myself hv classmates older than u. You might get qns like why r u only joining uni now, what were u doing b4 this etc but generally those r out of curiousity rather than judgy, and as long as u contribute to group work people will like u. 

Have fun in uni!"
ThaEpicurean,4,I wonder if younger students will get treated differently too
Same-Bookkeeper-1936,2,Had a fellow undergrad course-mate who was in his 50s at LSE (he was already a dad). We hung out at the bar as a group of students and had a jolly good time. 😃 I would go as far as to say that one’s insecurities and vulnerabilities make one unique. There really should be no shame. Congrats on realising your aspiration. What course?
Accomplished_Joke983,2,"Next time you go out to work, your superior will be a foreigner that is also younger than you."
aprilang123,1,"im not sure but i think that's actually very admirable, it's nothing to be ashamed of! if it makes u feel any better, i admire my poly classmates who enrolled in via pfp since i feel that it's more difficult to make it for pfp than to just pass o levels and enter a poly course hahah. i really respect your hustle!"
RTechBoy,1,"currently studying in NTU and im 28 this year, so its normal, although most people tell me i dont look like im 28 so there is that."
TreadmillOfFate,1,"Maybe if you clearly look older than most of your peers you might get a few weird glances/double-takes here and there, but for the most part people don't really care, especially once you start talking and getting to know the other person better.

Congrats on getting into uni!"
crystally_iwa,1,my dad signed on before going to uni so he was rly old like nearly 30 when he enrolled its fine bro i admire your resolve!!
jay_ongoing,22,From yijc here. Honestly I agree with you. The science notes provided are actually good and allows me to understand each topic with ease. I'm glad that you find yijc notes useful.
ExcitingYoghurt1553,13,"was a yijc graduate and yes ive been saying for years that the yijc bio notes are amazing, they really give as much info as possible for each topic and are better than many other jc bio notes. i had also browsed through many jc bio notes and ri, yijc and ejc stood out"

schroedingerscryptid,18,"hey there! i totally and absolutely understand where you're coming from, and forgive me for how brutal this is going to sound but **you are making a mistake.** 

i went through the exact same experience as you last year and trust me, i am feeling stressed about all my misconceptions and lack of memorizing from last year - burn out got to me and i just barely scraped through J1, and my dumbass now is only just realising the graveness of my mistake.

i won't scold, but i do suggest that you speak out to someone and take your work in in small and tiny bites; that way you can work yourself up to doing more and more and effectively try your best at studying in JC. and be consistent in your tutorials + be loud in class if you don't understand anything/see your tutor for help if needed. 

ganbare!! you can do it :D"
immathrowitawayrn,9,"Its totally normal to feel this way!! Do not beat urself up over it for being unable to cope. Truth is the content in jc is sadly an unfathomable amount to cover in 2 years, while maintaining good conduct, attendance and participation either in leadership roles or in cca and events. The bar is set really high and you shouldn't beat urself up for it

Let yourself feel this process by finding out what your limits are. It could be 1 hour of studying and you're tired already and that is totally ok. Take a break and then continue. Give yourself leeway, even if it is missing a few tutorials, assignment deadlines if there are things you need to focus more on such as PW or yourself. Pon school if you have to also, really take breaks if its getting too much, as long as you dont overdo it its fine

The point is, the point of JC isnt to find the smartest people but the ones with more willpower and resilience and sometimes humans just need their own time and space. You cant expect your grit and mentality to be tested at every second, you have to get out of it once in awhile and even if there are ppl who do better so be it, what matters is that you complete JC and you know you have that resilience.

Don't think that you're not as good or smart, because truthfully with any amount of time, anyone can study the syllabus with flying colours. Its to test your grit, and you will get through it. I believe in you"
ococwithsubduction,6,"for me i use a google sheet to keep track of what i’m doing like lecture, lecture notes, tutorial, tutorial notes, TYS/additional question, questions to consult. green denotes done and red denotes undone so it pushes me to get more green boxes. take this march holidays to rest and also catch up on your work. jia you 💪🏻"
#NAME?,2,"do your work during breaks. now this sounds a little barbaric because you feel like you trade off your time with your friends, but you keeping them accountable and completing work together can actually be a bonding experienceand shows you what friends are actually worth being friends with (those who don't want to do this will pull your grades down). helps especially if yall have things that you're not sure on bc you can cover various gaps faster and help each other"
HedgehogMost5145,2,"By spontaneous energy, do you mean you can really get going when you start work?"
Mattcha08,1,"jc is a marathon, not a sprint!! if you find yourself unable to do stuff, what i did was usually clear away the hardest stuff first. that’s because you not only showed to yourself that you overcame the inertia, the rest of the tasks can be done relatively easier. i used a personal discord server to type down my to-do list. on days where im busy, i will assign less stuff to do! [tho it sounds obvious,, its for me to not be burnt out the next day!!] (and sometimes when i feel like it, i will write on paper haha) also, do make use of the occasional breaks u have in your timetable! for me that helped a bit because im doing work with my friends, so that gives me allowance to ask questions in-person :)

jiayous op! this is the start, fighting! 💪💪"
ExcitingYoghurt1553,2,i was a private candidate last year and in my experience private was 10x more useful than in school but it really matters what your grades were originally. i had As Bs and Cs the first time around so i didnt need to have significant 4-5 grade improvements and had a generally decent understanding of my subjects so doing it privately just required me to practice more and more without having to work on the basic concepts in each subjects. i would suggest that you assess your grades and understanding of each subject and decide whether u can grasp it by yourself or require school help. im assuming u take arts? arts DEFINITELY need to go back to school bc u need constant rectification and feedback from teachers but for science its not necessary unless ure performing very poorly.
zhatya,75,"Local Uni non-med courses, no scholarships: RP is king. 

Being in a class committee adds nothing to your portfolio. Neither does volunteer work in non-high profile areas. If you’re a waiting until JC to start thinking about portfolio, it’s probably easier to just focus on RP."
lauises,29,"Quite sian about having to chime in on this because this comes up all the time but I'll bite.

1. In terms of portfolio, the most important thing to consider is how **RELEVANT** your experience is. Leadership roles usually don't count for much because most students take leadership as just a position to hold, not actually strategize and execute any culture/systems-changing work. Institutions and schools know this, so they have paid less attention to these things over time.

People with 'leadership experience' are plenty, especially with MOE creating more and more roles for students to be leaders. **GOOD leaders** are extremely rare, and you will generally not be asking questions about the relevance of your portfolio if you are one, because you will know that you are capable of good work and will make do with any position you may end up in. 

The same applies to the workforce. Workers are plenty. Talent is rare.

&#x200B;

2. Portfolio is most naturally and organically built when you have a clear sense of where you want to go in the future. Want to be an entrepreneur? Start a small business. Want to be a programmer? Start coding. If any part of the process sounds like a huge huge chore and you're not keen, your interest might not be very legit, to begin with. 

Big challenge for youth these days is that we spend so much time in school we forget how to be productive about the things we care about because school takes so much out of us. So we often go into a spiral of social media, youtube, and Netflix, just to cope. 

If you can let loose about the obsessive pursuit of grades and embrace your interests and fancies, you may start to find headspace and time to dig deeper into areas you care about. You'd kill two birds with one stone because your portfolio building ends up being things you enjoy doing anyway.

&#x200B;

3. Yes, grades help a lot. In some cases, perfect grades are all you need. The same can be said about life. If you are a billionaire, a lot of your problems can be solved. 

That said, if we decide to only believe in that 'truth', then we start to think that grades are the **only way** to succeed. Just as how we may believe having a ton of money **is the only way** to be happy. What we choose to believe ends up shaping how we see the world, and how the world manifests.

Truth is more complex. Grades matter, and portfolios too. Money matters, but inner peace and clarity too. Things are rarely made up of singular truths."
vajraadhvan,13,"I will say that developing your portfolio can be a great way to expand your network, which will be important for your career (especially given your uni course choices). You'll also be able to tap on your experiences working in teams, problem-solving, etc. in your uni work, internship/job interviews, and beyond.

That said, don't bite off more than you can chew. Also, doing things you're passionate about and will enjoy is far more important that doing things that will look the best on a resume or that you're already good at."
throwawayuniproblems,4,do you wanna go overseas? also it doesnt hurt to just try out some new activities. helps you become a well rounded person with a little sense of direction/purpose.
Toastwire,3,"I find It abit strange that you are worried over getting a good portfolio just to get a good course just so you could get a degree to secure a good starting salary in the working world. This is even assuming that your degree is even relevant to the job you wanna do when you've graduated and are more mature to think about what you really need. 

I think you need to think of the bigger picture, ultimately you just need to get a job that you are satisfied with that could support yourself n family.

Taking that into account, I think you should be more concerned about the portfolio you are building up for life rather than just for applying to uni courses. 

Speaking from experience, I too was not as active as my friends in primary , sec and jc and I can relate to you as to how you feel worthless or unachieving as compared to other people. However, I've always loved drawing art and creating artworks and I would save them onto my comp or post on deviant art and I'm glad to say that when it came to applying for a job after graduation, the portfolio that I have amassed had enough to show my employers what I'm capable of.

Lol actually I think I'm contradicting myself. Anyway portfolio is important but you should be working on the portfolio for your career in general, rather than a course. 

Apart from portfolio, your qualifications would only help you secure a starting salary, there's still the ability to communicate and socialize with people (which sadly I'm not good at)"
guobas,2,"i'd say just go for it, dont need some crazy thing, just class comm/cca comm will do. yes, rp is more important than everything at this stage. 

however, the unis DO conduct interviews if they have a few people competing for the last spot. i think getting a position in way more low-risk and easier in jc than uni so why not just do it now? 

there will be some point down the line you DO have to talk about leadership and/or volunteering work. one easy example is applying for student exchange in uni, or your internship interviews. and by talk about leadership/volunteering work, i dont mean only just look at the portfolio. there will be questions like describe how your leadership position in XXX helped you become better at XXX. if you dont have any experience, what are you going to say?"
aprilang123,1,"it makes ur linkedin profile look nice HAHAH
tbh i regret not taking up any leadership positions in poly"
VeryAmbitiousPerson,1,"Pre JC/Poly -> Pretty much useless, unless you are chasing for specific scholarship.

Pre Uni -> Depends. if you are chasing competitive course (density/medicine/law) or scholarship, then I would say its important. If you just wanna be a normal typical student, pretty much worthless.

Volunteer work is overrated. Everyone think so highly of volunteer work and participate in it. But in most cases, unless you do an insane amount (1000+ hours or 1-2 years), most of the volunteer work is nothing if significancy. Specifically its not a pillar you can rely on, its more of an evidence for ‘I enjoy helping people’ instead of my purpose in life is ‘serving others’. What you should be looking for, assuming you do not have huge connection, focus on a small but long term ones, because those really form a story of what you learnt/discovered about yourself.

Saw someone described building of portfolio as a journey. You need not craft THE PERFECT portfolio because it simply doesn’t exist. Its should be a collection of things you do to explore your interest and lesson you learnt.

A tip I would say is internship, but law firms I would imagine would be pretty tough."
Cute_Meringue1331,1,"Portfolio isnt just cca or volunteering. Also includes any competitions you entered or overseas immersion trips. If you wanna get a PSC scholarship or something, its very important."
omochiikaerii,1,"Not at all, don’t get ahead of yourself and get caught up in this portfolio chase. 

Your result is the most important factor, without RP or your nett score, nothing else would matter or salvage your position. I’m talking about portfolio like volunteering, leadership etc. 

Next you need to think is how relevant is your portfolio experience? If you’re gunning for tech, then having a couple CTF and hackathon under your belt would be helpful, not volunteering or leadership."
TheRayArmy,1,"Are you looking at the scholarships offered by the university? If so, do drop them an email to see if this arrangement is possible and, if you’re in a rush, call them to check but get it written down as a record.

83.75 is honestly a bit tough to secure a scholarship from the university but with a strong enough portfolio you might just stand a chance."

So if you see teachers acting out of ""character"" or letting themselves go, just avoid at all cost and don't confront them. Confronting teachers are usually lose-lose for everyone. It is only a win for you situation if you avoid the confrontation and let them embarrass themselves even more."
digitalghost_,8,"Need more context as to why your teacher screamed 😅

As human beings, we all have our unhealed wounds which we have to heal and NOT project it on others. But ill just share my experience not sure if it'll help for your case. There was a teacher in pri sch that singled me out to go outside the classroom just to scold and scream at my face (like really really loud and could see so much negative energy & hatred in her eyes, and I wasn't a bad student to begin with, I even see her as one of my fav teachers) for laughing along w a friend and others were laughing too (we were just cracking our own harmless jokes) but I just got picked on by the teacher and she scolded me only loudly outside class but was so loud that ppl inside the class could hear. And she scolded me for a very long time outside class....just for laughing.  And this was a SAP school.

As I grow up, I feel that she is projecting her stress and probz unhealed wounds and letting all out onto me by screaming at me, which was really unfair. Why would she let it out in front of an innocent child? If she wants, she could've scolded the whole group who laughed right? Why just me? The only thing I regretted was I got p traumatized after she screamed at me and singled me to go out of the class, and therefore I did not dare to speak up and tell my parents. Its really important to speak up before any regrets because till now it still haunts me....."

PlasticTourist3025,8,"When I was in J1, I struggled very badly with imposter syndrome bc I took PCMl against my will (I wanted h2 lit bc I was more passionate about lit than anything else hahah and I'm weaker at the sciences). Bc of imposter syndrome and many other factors (eg cca, travelling time, can't understand stuff), I failed most of my CAs and was preparing to retain (I rmb getting like 5/35 once lmfao). But I mugged vv hard and got Bs and Cs for promos yayyy :"")

In j2, it was ok at first but then again I started struggling with many things inside and outside of school and I flunked my myes (Es and Ds). For context, I come from a 'top' class in a mid tier jc and my ft has very high expectations for everyone (she wants everyone to get As and Bs only and there were many ppl scoring much better). I then had a wake up call and mugged rly hard for prelims bc I was scared of getting my j1 grades again, but sadly I wound up with CCE/BB (67.5rp with pw A). My ft said I was underperforming (she's my phy teacher too) and she said that I needed to pull myself tgt if not I can't get As for a levels. (This made me even more stressed and anxious lol)

But I continued mugging/consulting chers and all that until a levels coz can't do anything else right. For the record I thought As was kind of hard esp for chem and math so I was expecting Cs. So I was vv surprised when I got BBB/BAA for As (81.25rp). Like ok it looks mid lah coz straight Bs but I never expected anything above 80 lmao. 
Now thinking back, I don't regret my subject combination at all bc I got to be with so many amazing intelligent classmates (some of them got 87-90rp and I'm so proud of them and ofc my jc too so don't u ever roast/underestimate mid tier jcs).  And my ft who keeps bugging me heheh.  In other words, anything is possible don't give up!!!!! 🤗 ❤ (tho now I hate the sciences more than ever)

Tldr: didn't score v well throughout j1 and j2 due to stress/imposter syndrome/many factors in general. Got 81.25rp for As"

Right now, most JC2 are busy either with SYF or their sports competition. It is normal to feel suffocated. When everything dies down eventually, you will have more than enough time to catch up. That is if you don't procrastinate and actually focus.

If you want more specific advice, I've written an article on my blog, ""NOW WHAT"" (link in Reddit profile), on how to prepare for the June holidays, Prelim, and eventually your A levels.

Good luck."
PlasticTourist3025,5,"Ofc it's possible to do well for As regardless of how you did for internal school exams. I've seen it with my own eyes!! And while I think it's important to aim high, be realistic with yourself. While 90rp might be an attainable score, there are various factors on the actual exam day that may not work to your favour. And we all have diff academic capabilities too.

Stay in the present and focus on one thing at a time. Strengthen your j1 foundation and close your knowledge gaps first before moving on to j2 stuff. You have enough things to do now so don't overthink about the future and hyperfixate on that 90rp. It's still early in the year, you have time. You may not get 90rp for myes, but what's more important is taking it seriously and using it as a checkpoint to see where you're still lacking.  Fast forward to when you receive your a level results, I want you to feel proud of what you scored, bc it's an indication of all your effort and hard work. That's how you know you've done your best ❤"
heartglimpses,2,"I had trouble adjusting between Os and As because my secondary school pretty much spoon fed me what I needed to know and all I had to do was regurgitate it. When it came to As, it hit hard that the free handouts had ended… you can’t just read notes and do well, but there has to be an actual understanding and mastery of the topics.

The good news is, you have figured out you want to do something about it… and once you take up the responsibility for your own learning, you’re on the right trajectory!!! 

I highly recommend asking friends and tutors for help. It’s not just mugging more but checking in to see if you’re understanding the concepts right and approaching questions the right way.

NaAlOH4,6,"Graduated in 2019. Had CCA on Wednesdays and Fridays until 7pm, and usually stayed until 7.30-8pm. These days you have to either suck thumb or finish your assignments in advance.

My tutors liked to post their tutorial plans a week or a month before the tutorials so I could tell which assignment were due on which day, but most of them were tutorial questions that were gonna be gone through in class so my classmates tended to rush them during recess breaks.

The key thing is to stay ahead of the lectures and tutorials, rather than play catch up. Sacrifice this coming weekend and catch up on all your assignments for the week, at least those you can complete or due soon. Next, go and read up lecture notes for the next topic that's gonna be taught in lectures. Catch up on your sleep too, make sure to get 7-8 hours of sleep a day, maybe the exception being CCA days, but still do try. 

I was 1-2 full topics ahead for H1 Chemistry and H2 Mathematics, and made sure to read up the lecture notes in advance for H2 Econs and Physics. Simple things like writing the summary of a paragraph beside it helps you to remember better. Idk if you take econs, but most school notes write a chunk of information when it can be summarised in a few arrows (Rise in income -> rise in purchasing power -> assuming normal good -> shortage -> dd increase) These 4 arrows help to summarise maybe 4-5 sentences worth of notes into easily readable format.

If you are struggling for any topics for any subjects I've mentioned above, maybe can lmk, i try n see whether I can recommend you my study methods for that particular topic. The entire JC syllabus can be self learnt if you are independent enough, I only went to lectures to reinforce my learning and see the correct way to present my workings.

I didn't have tuition either, but made sure I had the discipline to study on my own. I could NEVER study at home because of computer games, so I forced myself to study as much as I could in school, before going home to play that few hours (prob like 5 lol) of games everyday.

Playing catchup is never the way to go for JC and Uni. It's like you are learning two topics at once because once you miss out one topic, you have to revise that topic AND learn the new topic at the same time, which confuses your brain more since it's taking in twice the information at one go. I tried playing catchup for a few topics in Econs and I can tell you up till today, I have never fully mastered the concepts in that one topic, while the rest of the topics I can still remember it vividly today.

Hackzx_,2,">For NTU, Would a single degree in business specialising in finance (3 years) do or would a double degree with business and accountancy (4 years) be a better option?

It doesn't really matter.

Biz with finance specialisation will be sufficient for IB/high finance. In fact these days, what course you come from doesn't matter much to the banks already. Your internship experience and your ability to pass case interviews etc. are far more important and IB will be very competitive to get in, regardless of whether you are single or double degree.

>Would it be better to be like at the top of the NTU cohort or an average student in NUS/SMU? I’ve always felt that maybe being at the top at NTU might be more beneficial but correct me if I’m wrong.

For a start, most investment banks only shortlist those with FCH for interviews, so GPA is really important if you want to even have a chance of getting into IB.

So yeah choosing whichever school which you think you can get a higher GPA will be beneficial. But tbh if you're top student material, you will do well regardless of whether you are in NUS/SMU/NTU and there isn't really any school that will be ""easier"" to score well in, competition for good grades will be heavy in any of the 3 schools."

&#x200B;

NUS is great and some places will prefer NUS, but just be able to maintain FCH tbh. NTU i would say it is possible but if you do NBS it's 3 years to grad and that wouldnt give you enough time to source for good internships leading to BB or good PE places for conversion (unless you are lucky/have connections). I would rather go for a school that offers 4 years as baseline to graduate, and drop to no-honours to clear in 3 years if I'm lucky to get a conversion at a BB summer internship. If not, you still have the option to extend to 5th year to get one more summer internship opportunity to enter IB/PE.

\*Doing a ddp in 4 years at NTU would mean you have to juggle more work to clear and make sure you can graduate. Not sure if it allows you to take LOA for internships + graduate in 3 years if you drop 2nd degree, or if you can graduate in 4 years without mugging ur life out and not having enough time to prep for IB interviews. No point in having DDP if no internship to even break into IB."

3. Sleep. Turned google maps on and fell asleep on the bus. Google sent me a notif 2 stops prior and I woke up, packed my shit and left

I think it's good to invest in ANC earphones if you want to study on the MRT.

ANC + instrumental music helps block out most of the ambient noise so you can focus.

Oh_Wiseone,3,"I am not a student but have to travel 1.5 hours each way for work. I use the time for work, not sleep or not watching movies. The reason being - when I get home, I don’t want to continue working (or in your case studying) - I want to enjoy my time at home with my dogs, family, friends etc rather than soon work. So I change my mindset that my commuting time is my studying time that I have to do anyways. 

I found a bus that I could get directly to work (short transfer on MRT to get to bus). I found most people on the bus was sleeping, so actually pretty quiet. But just in case I had my headset with me. Most of my work, I had on my iPad, and it has SIM card, so I could do email, research on Google etc. I made sure I downloaded any big videos or documents before leaving the house. And I always brought a nice tea/coffee/hot drink in an insulated bottle so I was comfortable. I always arrived at work prepared and ready for the day, so you can use this time to be ready for tests, classes etc.

On the way back, reverse and do your homework. That way, when you arrive, most of the stuff is done and I can now have a great dinner and relax. You probably will need some exercise or something active after sitting for so long. Hope that helps !"

i used to study on the way to sch but it was quite troublesome since i needed to keep transferring lines/buses, so i figured a good route where i needed to transfer the least so i could just settle down and avoid having to move around. by a levels i realised that it was much better for me to rlly put aside distractions and study my way till max 12-1am, and nap again during transport to give me a peace of mind before the exams lol. say real the best thing u cld give urself is extra sleep and rest on ur long ass transport… no point cramming things into ur head.

Impulsivemental,1,"Hi OP, I am in a similar situation to you!

Here are some things I did to make my life more bearable:

1. I start the day at 630am, regardless of my class timings. My earliest class starts at 815am. Routinely waking up at 630 allows enough time to prepare in the morning, whilst ensuring my body is always ready for the 815am class (both physically and emotionally)

2. I conduct all activities in school. Im not sure if your school has the relevant amenities for you to do, but this is what I normally do. I eat, exercise in school. Commuting 1.5 hours each way might not leave you with very much time and energy to study or exercise. I try to make my life as comfortable in school by bring accessories (such as a stand for my Ipad as a second screen) or bringing my showering things to shower after i gym or run.

3. I remain discipline during the day. This might be easier said than done. I generally limit my usage of social media/ video watching etc (‘rest time’) to commuting hours or during meals. I know that the commute is shag, so ‘resting’ on the train might make your trip that much more enjoyable.

4. I take a one day break. Honestly, the 3 hour daily commute messes with your mental capacity and physical shagness. I normally take one day off a week to just fully reset my body - the daily routine will really take a toll on you if you dont rest enough.

In any case, just try to find a routine that suits you! Atb in your studies OP!"

Koufas,2,"Hello. In short

> most of such courses may render me less attractive in the job market when I graduate

I disagree - what you study is starting to become much less relevant compared to your skills (which you can gain through internships). For example, I am a social science student doing my last internship this Summer at a bulge bank. What makes you attractive is not what's on your paper when you graduate. Its what your skills are

>How should i proceed from here? 

1. Figure out what you like and what you think you might like to learn more about
2. Shortlist potential courses based on what you like. Read the student handbooks (eg SMU SOE student handbook) of those courses that you have shortlisted
3. Apply to all of them

>And what recommendations/things should I know about each uni?

I have written plenty of answers about things like this on this sub, with a perspective of an SMU student. Many others have as well with their own universities. Use the Search Bar to look for specific questions. Here are some of my past answers that you might find useful:

polymathicus,23,"Hey OP! Former U student who went to B in 3 months and then to an A. No supplemental tuition. Loves math, however.

Math is like walking through a giant maze. Most of the time, you *have* to make the mistakes, get stuck, walk down the dead end to realize that this isn't the way. How you're feeling... it's literally the learning process. Soon you'll develop an instinct to know what not to try in a similar situation, thereby becoming more efficient.

Two tips:
1) Be confident and optimistic before attempting a problem. This puts you in a more adventurous mood so you'll be predisposed to explore more methods. You are going to solve the sh*t out of this problem!


2) The most important thing to ask a tutor is not how to solve a question, but ""what made you take this step? What did you see from before that made you take this step? I saw X and that's why I tried Y - why wouldn't you try Y?"" Pick up their intuition.

JooSeul,1,"for the laptop requirements, you can find it via the course’s website.

also, i was from CEP (covid batch). some quick tips for your year 1

watching freecodecamp’s python course on youtube and practicing it should be enough for you to understand the basics of python & allow u to do your sch work easily. i would say watching that 4 hours of youtube vids > lectures in poly but that’s just IMO haha. IMHO, youtube vids > NYP lectures (not just python) +++ now y’all got chatGPT, which makes learning so much easier tbh so fully utilise it as long as it is allowed by the school.

at the end if semester 1, you will get to choose electrical or mechanic route. choose your route carefully based on the diploma you want to take in year 2. you will get to choose your diploma at the end of year 1 semester 2. you will most likely get the diploma of your choice if your GPA is good/excellent.

JoshyJoshyJosh,1,"Not an accountancy student but I think I can still help with the questions

1. All lessons in SMU are seminar based. You take an average of 4CUs per semester and each CU amounts to 3h15min (the extra 15min is normally a break) per week. Class time slots are 8:15am -11:30am, 12pm-3:15pm, 3:30pm-6:45pm, 7pm-10:15pm. You would be expected to prepare for seminars before the lesson starts, but the amount of prep varies depending on the module
2. Yes, I think for the mods I've taken so far, class part accounts for 10% of your total grade. Modules are split into your degree specific modules and the more general modules such as communication and culture modules and in these, class part is also present so it's not just your accounting mods you need to worry about!

Suspicious_Dino,1,"Hi there! Ive also applied for SIT’s OT 2023 intake, applied this Monday (6/3) and got an interview offer yesterday (8/3). I was from the JC track and normally they would prefer poly students more than JC students for therapy related courses. Hmm my rank point is 75/90, not excellent not very bad. 

I think one thing that probably allowed me to get the interview so quickly would be my personal statement. Similarly, I didn’t participate much in my JC CCA, but have a long term excuse to cover my absence. So I feel that even if your result is not the best, it’s definitely worth a try especially with your courage to do a course that is different (nursing to OT). Smth must have fuelled your inner determination to make the change, use that as your strong thesis in your PS. Or throughout your nursing days, there might be some instances where you feel the calling to be a therapist instead of a caregiver. You can go search for the important qualities of a therapist, leverage on that as well as personal experience and I think it will show how keen you are. Lastly, use your gap year to reflect on what you have observed in sg’s population— rising ageing population. Community care is one aspect that the Govt is trying to push people into, hence showing your interest in CC can help?

And also you can’t use CLB as part of your l1r4/l1r5, you can only use it to meet the MTL requirement

OP would also not consider any chinese intensive courses eitherways. Basically there is no cons (unless you only take 6 subjects incl chinese) other than the lower proficiency.

cons: 

1. can't be used in l1r5 computation as the grades are only merit/pass/ungraded, so make sure u have at least 6 other subjects including el and humanities

PlasticTourist3025,9,"Hii I second the other comments! However, you may want to look into taking english/lit overseas if possible, as I feel that learning such subjs in their actual country of origin provides a richer learning experience (sorry if my phrasing is off, but a lot of the classic writers/poets come from english/European countries yk).  

 Imo retaking As with arts stream is the best bet...as painful as it may sound. I think some overseas unis, esp the recognised ones will look at your As results too but u shld search up and see which ones need good a level marks/ don't need? But even if they don't need, you most likely need to take foundation modules. All the best yeah :-) (fellow science hater and english lit liker here)

Edit: in sg its rly one or the other 😔 and you *can't* rly run away from all the difficult things.  honestly I think you can consider this route too which is quite practical imo: mass comms in poly -> english/mass comms in local uni and pursue journalism or smt.

goodguyzai,2,">Is Intel or AMD better?

Depends on the individual model. 

>Should I stick to a 14 inch ? Is a 16 inch too heavy?

14' vs 16' is for me a debate between screen space (seeing more stuff) vs portability (size). Which one is more important for you depends on you - for example: I prefer 14' because I have a monitor at home that I use for editing. My bag also doesn't fit 16' laptops. 16' does not necessarily mean heavier - that depends on the internal components.

>Are the files for design work big and is 512GB storage enough?

Well, depends. If you're working on video projects those are definitely very big files. 512 isn't probably gonna be enough for 3 years IMO - but you're not gonna get much value from buying a 1tb one IMO as compared to buying a external drive. Would recommend spending the bucks on a proper external SSD though, which may amount to around the same price."

Balancing mental health is always a personal battle. This kind of thing I truly believe you'll never get an answer from others - you really need to discover yourself. And a lot of the times advice you get for this kind of thing is really useless because different people got different predicament.

If you think that tenacity, intellect or whatever measurement of competence you have in mind is going to automatically convert you a 4.0 in RP, be warned that you're generally going to be very miserable once the first few grades hit you in RP.

I am not saying that being academically inclined does not help, it definitely does. It's a boon in fact, for you to excel, but RP grading system does not look solely upon what you're capable of doing, but more of how capable you are of showing you know what you're doing, even if you don't know what you're doing, if it makes any sense.

It's an exact simulation of the workplace, where you have a few people who are extremely driven, the majority being average in competency and the minority few who does not give a conceiving fuck even if the titanic is sinking.

If you want to do well, you're going to have to be the one that lead the crowd and take charge in a lot of things, even if you absolutely hate doing so.

For a start, I suggest you stare into the mirror everyday and practice how to smile.  Practice how to conduct yourself, how your mannerisms are, because they are going to be decisive in terms of grades.

This is the objective truth that I don't see people talk about. 

If you're going to score a 4.0, you better make sure you're never late, your faci loves you and your grades are mostly above average, with some average lessons here and there. 

You CANNOT afford to be below average."

You must pass English (minimum C6), at least one math subject (minimum D7) and your mother tongue (minimum D7). However, there are also conditional admission which you can find out more on the moe website I’ve linked here https://www.moe.gov.sg/post-secondary/admissions/jae/admission-criteria 

As for the “bellcurve”, maths and sciences (be it combined or pure) is known to request a much higher score than the regular 70-75% for an A. Humanities does depend on the specific combination and no one really knows the benchmark for an A. 

All the best for O Levels."

You can take a look at the marking rubrics for O level econs to see how they mark the papers (I think they mark very leniently - markers will still give you marks even if you miss out keywords) 

I feel that JC econs is also quite different from secondary school econs, the topics are roughly the same but much more in depth and teachers are more strict about the answering techniques, and having knowledge of econs from secondary school didn't really help me much. Many of my classmates who took econs in secondary school also chose to take h1 econs instead of h2 so it's really up to your decision.

Repulsive-Pea3394,1,"hi, as someone who took pure hist for O’s last year this is what I have to say. 

The first qn is, are you planning to go JC? if yes, what subject combi in JC? most ppl in science stream do H1 econs( it can be other humanities as well ) and art stream usually contains H2 econs. for pure hist, it really isnt just about memorising. ur sbq skills must ne very strong, its worth 30/50 marks,, scoring well for SBQ essentially guarantees ur pass. the last 20 marks is SEQ where you apply ur understanding of what you have learnt n you ans the qn. its not rlly memorising( you can memorise model ans but its not advised ). The second qn is pure hist has quite a number of chapters which are lengthy and contain of many factors etc and theres more content compared to elec history so you must rlly ensure you stay interested through out. At the end of the day, the decision is urs, for me I would say pure history O’s is quite ez. I was always interested but nv rlly scored well ( i think i averaged a C6 ) but i got a B3 for O’s. it all goes down to how well you understand the content and not just memorising."

Then_Box_6544,2,"Take all that I write with a pinch of salt especially since I took O levels 2-3 years ago haha 

For geog I previously gave these tips so I hope it’ll be useful this is what worked for me and I hope it helps you ! I’ve always gotten really bad marks for pure geog (B4-E8) but after doing all these I got an A at Os, but also think it has to do with moderation and some miracle. Anyways, 
1. Do not purely memorise content . Make sure you understand it . Pure memorisation may not get you far but if you understand the content in the case of an exam where you freak out and forget all you memorised you can rely on your content knowledge !! I’m not saying don’t memorise as it is still a humanities subject but understanding and then memorising will make ur life much easier 

2. Look at how many marks the questions are. Except the LORMS qn . For the rest of the questions, use the number of marks as a base to see how many points you should write . Do not overwrite as time is limited !! 

3. Refer to syllabus document (can be found on SEAB website !) and look at all their requirements. Are you able to answer / meet what they say ? If yes , good ! If not , go back and revise or clarify with your teacher :) ! Also refer to the page with all the words ( eg. Describe , Explain etc) and see what they mean or how you are supposed to answer the qn. Eg: Describe: Give descriptions, what can you see, is the lava liquidy etc, Compare: give similarities and differences

4.Time Management . Allocate your time properly. I suggest you take about 15m for LORMS qn . For the rest of the qn , allocate about 1-1.5mins per mark . So , a 3 mark qn maybe you take 5mins , 4 mark qn 6-7mins etc . You don’t want a time where you are left with half the paper undone and only half an hour left . 

5. Keep calm, don’t panic . You know what you have studied and tell yourself that :D

Let me know if you want notes for geog even though it’s pure geog from 2/3 years ago and not sure if it will help you haha 

For sciences I took combined sciences but what worked for me was doing a lot of practice papers and TYS. But don’t just do it plainly and be happy that oh I competed 10 papers. Instead what I did was print out other school papers you can easily find it online, do it and mark it then consult my teachers about what went wrong and learn from it. Slowly I knew where I went wrong and started scoring better. Only then I moved on TYS but do what suits you. You will realise that science questions are related and repeated from time to time. I would sometimes write the explanation or whatever my teacher said on true practice test papers I did so I can go back and revise and not make the same mistakes again. 

I sucked at SS so I can’t really give you tips. If you have really supportive teachers, go for consultations. I can’t stress this enough but consultations work miracles. I was always the average student (scored high 10s to 20s in school exams) but after I put my ego down and was determined to do better, I consulted different subject teachers every week/ fortnight and O levels turned out better than I had expected.

Any further questions, feel free to PM and I’ll try to help :))"
cai_tao_kueh,2,"for pure chem/phy/bio, it's all about *fully* understanding the concepts for every chapter, and ensuring that you have sufficient practice. try to do more topical worksheets based on the chapters that you are weak on, and you can ask your tutor to focus more on the topics that you're struggling with. there are certain topics like moles that are very essential come the o levels, so you must make sure that you master the relatively easier topics before you head on to the more complicated ones. don't rush.

for humanities (social studies), it is important to check the news every day and categorise them based on the chapters you have learn in your tb (eg. malaysia chicken export ban - economic/cultural issues for sg?) for sbq, you must master the formats and start timing yourself for every practice paper you do, as you must manage your time wisely during the examinations. you need to think faster, write faster.

for amaths/emaths, same as the sciences. do more practices and focus more on mastering the easy topics. if you need help, ask your teachers and friends to slowly go through with you, step by step. my dms are open to any questions, just message me if you have any clarifications)

for english, try to write more compositions and take some time to create and develop a vocabulary bank. for oral, you must watch more news, dive deeper into certain topics to aid you in your spoken interaction. notice how the speaker expresses himself and use articulate body motions to not sound monotonous. if possible, figure out the main points and how the speaker rebuts any counter-argument. for comprehension/listening comprehension, do more practice (especially your summary) and let your teacher mark. during the holidays, it would be beneficial for you to do more practice papers, to develop your comprehension skills and learn to answer the question.

math_dydx,13,">im looking at smu law and cs because there are some niche roles this degree can take (eg legal advisor for tech companies(?)), plus i did better than expected for my A levels so it seems a bit wasted to just study biz

You should never feel wasted studying a degree course with a cut-off much lower than your RP, if that degree course is exactly the one that can realise your potential and you are most interested in.

A lot of students, especially those who scored close to perfect RP, fall into the trap of thinking the best course is the course that optimises the usage of their result, i.e. go to a course with IGP that suits your RP. This is no longer like choosing JC where no matter which JC u go, everyone ends up taking the same A-Levels. Many people fail to realise that the best course for a prospective uni student is the course that can best realise your own potential. And how to realise your potential? It is the time now (choosing uni now) to choose a course that capitalises on your strengths, and works towards becoming the best in your own chosen field!

IGP is really demand and supply of vacancies. It doesn't mean that low IGP courses have poorer prospects. Ultimately, if you realised your strengths and interests in aligned with a low IGP course, then just go for it as it is the best course that can realise your potential. And also, with a good A-Level score, there is a higher chance to get a uni unbonded scholarship for the lower IGP course.

Also, law, cs, and biz (there are many specialisation under business) are 3 very different things to study. You need to look in detail at the curriculum (modules studied) and see what are the content each of them learns and see which one suits u, and interests u more."

smile_santa,1,"Just do it. It won’t cost you that much anyway and you will never know if you need it. 

I had to retake my o levels as well cos I flunked my maths and science and couldn’t go anywhere, but I had to register for a private school, otherwise I had to head straight for NS. Ended up costing my parents about $2000? ( I think. It was a long time ago). But since you are already accepted into poly, you can just attend the exam as a private candidate. 

Just make sure u don’t fuck it up the next time. When I was in secondary school, my English teacher told me a story. She had this student who is very poor in English and she was so worried about flunking her English. So leading up to the O levels she was writing compositions for my English teacher to grade almost everyday. She worked her socks off and got an A2 (she was barely passing her English before that). So it is entirely possible to get much better at it if you are determined."

Transparisteele,3,"Whichever school offers the most opportunities for exchanges abroad especially to the United States, (and it has to be a highly regarded university or program) would be ideal. When each school offers you their placement - (if I am reading your background correctly you have no shortage of choices), ask them about exchange programs and opportunities to go abroad for study or internship. That is the biggest factor in exposing you to opportunities. 

Locally there are not many avenues for entrepreneurship, so it’s best to make connections with people who are based in SV and have friends or money or job opportunities so you can grow there. 

The choice of course shouldn’t matter if you really have the drive and skills you claim, but you should make certain that you’re not misleading yourself when you say “I want to be a tech entrepreneur”. 

No school can teach you how to be a success at your own business. It takes guts and luck. So pick in accordance with what I’ve said above, get the most and best opportunities to work or study abroad (especially in the US technology universities) or SV  and make your impact felt there."

Transparisteele,2,"Let uncle tell you a story. 

I am a working adult who once was a student in a fairly “lousy school”, but now it has a decent reputation, but at the time it was full of gangsters or at least you would call them young punks.

I used to attend the best class in that school at an express level, but I was a lazy and unmotivated student. If I didn’t do well in a subject I would make excuses like “oh I’m not so smart to learn it, I’m more of a <other subject> kind of person. 

But for math it was especially bad. I was a barely pass E math student, and I was second to last in the level for A math. The well meaning A math teacher had to speak to me and ask me if I wanted to drop it because “I was not Coping well with the subject”. 

I got incredibly annoyed at the idea that someone else other than me can essentially insinuate that I was stupid. Sure math isn’t my forte, but this is just sec 3/4 math leh. It’s not even university level or A level mathematics. 

I told him no, and told myself if I wanted to prove him wrong I should definitely get at least an A in math. I went from being the second lowest scorer in the level for a math to an A2 (idk if they still use these grades) for A math come O levels. 

You, my friend just need the right motivation to focus. I believe if you want it, you will succeed. Don’t let anything distract you, boys, girls, home life, friends, if you want to prove to yourself you are worthy of something, you should just do it. It isn’t easy, but you’re capable of it if you apply yourself."
notbeepboop,2,"Coming from experience, i started off s2 being bottom of class (<30marks), i went into s3 taking both A and Emath. With some hard work i managed to get excellent results for them in Os. 

Firstly, avoid dropping A math as it closes many opportunities down the line, esp if u want to go into uni! Amath also helps alot in JC if that is ur desired path as H2 math esp takes alot of continuation from Amath

Heres my suggestion! Start off by reviewing the concepts of the topics u aren’t sure. After doing sec sch math for a while, u will realise that the methods are quite similar, more so regurgitating the method to apply to the different questions.

Instead of practicing using TYS like what others suggest, i would recommend u do other school’s papers first as they are often harder. Instead, save the Os TYS for the last sprint as preparation for school exams is a little different from Os. Try doing timed practice a couple weeks before ur major exams and try to aim to hit a target score u feel comfortable. Emath is ultimately quite repetitive and focus on being focused and avoid careless errors! As for Amath, practise questions and understand the various methods and steps required for different kinds of questions. 

In exams, if u get stuck in the question, move on ! don’t waste time at the question as time is often limited in the papers, come back after a while and try to secure as many marks as possible. even if they are method marks. 

All the best !!! U still have quite a long while to go before Os and u definitely can do it!!"

cai_tao_kueh,2,"emaths should be one of the subjects that you'll do well in for the o levels. don't worry too much now! the great thing is that you're only sec 3. 

for mathematics, here are some important pointers:

- stay consistent on EVERY TOPIC. don't learn one topic in school and then neglect it. you'll start panicking come the O Level paper, because you only touched that topic once and leave it in the dust. that's a mistake I've noticed my classmates commit.

- practice makes perfect. ok it sounds cliche but unfortunately (or fortunately) it's true. you can start doing sec 3 topical papers so that you will master every topic you have learnt. don't rush on learning a new topic until you can ensure you know every single concept and can answer the questions without any hesitation

- ask your teachers and peers for help. don't stay in the dark whenever you face certain difficulties in ANY TOPIC. even if the topic is easy and you fear that your classmates will laugh at you merely because you can't comprehend one of the easiest topics, don't give a shit about them. you can privately message your teacher, ask the friends that you trust. my dms are open to any e/amaths help, just drop me a text if you need any clarifications!

- try to get notes from your seniors. i have a discord server that has all of my senior's notes for every subject, dm me for the link! if not, you can refer to your textbook and jot down the different concepts. apply those concepts onto your practice, and don't forget to compile your practices for your reference in the future once you're done!

_UwU_hEEp,2,"I would say, don’t drop amath if you’re planning to, because I know of a lot of people who would wanna drop amath if they cannot do emath. 

Emath actually a lot of questions from test paper has same concept from questions in tys, you have to do it and know how to apply it. My teacher always tells us actually the questions aren’t different, I mean they’re phrased differently but what they are asking for is the same. You have to recognise the pattern from it. Math is something you have to keep practising. Just try to do at least one question everyday before you go to sleep (even if you’re very busy that’s how I do it). Also ask questions if you don’t understand, don’t paiseh if you’re just after lesson faster go chase the teacher ask them mostly they would one lah one or two Karens might not but at least try to. 

As a Sec three student, I can understand your pain. It’s okay to fail now better than you fail in olevels (my amath cher keep saying that I mean he made a fair point). You still got a year just keep improving on yourself find methods that works for you. You can do it believe in yourself💪💪.

Eurito1,1,"You should compare the NP and TP modules. I think you'll be happier studying in TP since it's the course that you actually want instead of NP. So if I were you, I would pick TP."
lnfrarad,1,"I’m hearing 2 things here.

First are your short term goals about stuff you wish to do in np with friends and cca

Second your long term goal, to complete your course of study and go to ntu comm studies. 

Let me ask if you go to np and take up tourism will that affect your chances of getting into ntu comms ?

Next if it does affect (in a bad way) then what is more important to you ? The short term goal or long term goal?

Ps: btw I’m not suggesting one option over the other. I just trying to highlight what I see as the possible deciding factor."

PlasticTourist3025,92,"Firstly I want to say congrats on your results!! You did amazing despite what you think. I believe that you worked vv hard indeed.

My situation is kind of similar to yours, a levels was rly traumatising for me and it really strained a number of my relationships (which in turn caused my performance to slip a bit). I come from a mid tier jc and I got slightly above the average rp and I think(?)and I can get into the courses I want so I was actually quite happy. However, just like you, a number of my classmates did quite well and are eligible for scholarships (not me doe 🤡). And yeah it's quite stressful to think about bc I'm from a middle income family and uni is 💸💸. Maybe you can try to apply for bursaries/financial aid.

Do your friends know how you feel? If you didn't tell them that you were upset and wanted space/reassurance, they prob assumed you're happy and everything's fine. As such you might want to ask them to be more sensitive to your feelings atp.  Also I just wanted to say that sometimes life is like that.....we work rly hard but the final results don't really justify that.  However, everyone has diff academic capabilities, and I'm sure you shine💫💫 brighter in other areas. Either way, scoring around the mean in a top tier jc is a great feat imo (as a mid tier jc person)!!! You have so much potential ahead of you, and even if you 'don't succeed' this time, you'll most likely achieve smt so much greater and better in the future.  ATB for uni apps ❤

Edit: to add on yeah ik it sounds cliché but even though grades are important, they don't define you at any point in time.  At the end of the day, while it will take you places, it's only a material success that will leave you feeling empty and won't satisfy you yk, so it's rly not worth placing so much hope and expectations on it. Take time to invest in your hobbies/passions/friend and family relationships, and take care of your own needs as well, as these would make you feel more fulfilled :-)"
studycookie,38,"literally in the same situation also (friends doing better, financial concerns, etc.). all my friends did crazy well and it made me so demoralised even though i improved so so much and never expected to not need to retain, let alone be eligible for the course i want 😭😭.  

the advice that i’ve been trying to tell myself is
1. you should try for scholarships/bursaries even if you think you cmi, then you don’t regret not trying 
2. the world isn’t fair but how you choose to make use of the resources available to you is what matters (there’s seriously A LOT of financial aid available in uni, don’t let $$ stop you!! working part time is also an option to save up before uni starts)

everyone says grades doesn’t matter but who are the people getting affirmed in schools? (the top scorers lor). we spent most of our lives in an education system that worships straight A’s over other kinds of success. it’s completely valid for you to feel upset, and know that you can pave your own form of success in the future 💕"
deepsapphites,58,"op i can relate to a lot of things you've said, though i was never as diligent as you in jc so just know that i'm proud of you for surviving such a difficult period.

like the other comment said, you can look into bursaries, and i'll also suggest mid-term scholarships that you can try applying for when you're in uni. 

if it's hard to be around your friends, you can consider communicating that while you're happy for them, you don't feel comfortable looking at all the uni stuff with them, take time to focus on your apps and encourage & be there for them when you can. i'm sure they would understand and want you to be happy as well.

i know it hurts to feel like your hard work did not pay off, but i wanna encourage you to keep up your work ethic bc it will serve you well down the road.

also, i understand that your sense of self-worth has likely hinged on your academic performance maybe your whole life, partly bc it's pretty much been a full-time job from primary school to jc. now that you have a few months before uni starts, go explore your interests, all the things you couldn't do bc you were too busy studying. check in with yourself every week and ask what you enjoyed about your week. did you eat something you love or always wanted to try? did you do something you were happy about? did you wear something nice? what was a random thought you had? what did you like about yourself that week? etc. 

i have been in your position before (still am honestly) so i cannot say the jealousy/bitterness will pass quickly. it likely won't for a while. but be kind to yourself and remember that just bc you didn't get the results you wanted this time doesn't mean your effort was wasted. your process made you more resilient, more disciplined, and those are intangible qualities that will carry you through life.

all the best and take care!"
Deseyebags,16,"Hi op, I believe we faced similar issues, tho I took my results 3 years ago. 

I’ll admit, life isn’t all rosy. The friends who scored way above me, are now living their best lives in rc inside nus, while I’m only able to take computing at smu (an achievement definitely, but I’m sure u can see why I feel small compared to them). My best friend went ahead, got himself a gf in rc within the first sem and now it’s almost as if he has no time for. 

I could have gone to nus if that’s wat I wanted and taken business or smth instead, but that wouldn’t have made me happy. That sort of compromise, and I wouldn’t even guarantee myself a spot at hall or rc. I used to belittle myself for only managing to get into smu, when I primed my self for nus for a gd part of my life. 

However, after spending a semester here, I’m glad to say I’m in smu. Yes my campus isn’t as big as nus or ntu, but it’s so easily accessible from my own home. Furthermore, I even got a chance to represent my school for a culture club im passionate about, which I never thought I would be able to do. 

I still get jealous over my nus friends, and it does feel on some occasions that I’ve been left behind, but life goes on. I hope u find ur own way soon, because idt the uni life u envisioned is completely gone, just that it may come packaged differently."
BaeJHyun,20,"If you say your situation is bad that’s because you’re comparing yourself to others

You don’t have to be obligated to be happy for them, if it hurts your mental health associating with them, cut them out.

There are those who also worked as hard but never made it to nus/ntu. Their IGP probably can only got to 1-3 courses and they’re not interested in those. The sch fees are heavily subsidised and you can take loans from banks as long as you get a place so scholarships are more of prestige more than anything. 

Those who couldn’t make it to courses in nus ntu - life moved in for them, they picked themselves up, removed negative energy and focused on their own journey


You OP, should too. Comparison is the thief of joy. Find happiness in your own journey, scholarships and chasing money is not one of them"
YOU_PASSED,7,"Similar to you, I was doing rather well in academics up until A levels where I flunked a H2. Not only was I unable to get into any local uni, my alma mater refused to let me repeat year 2.

Long story short, I survived my depression and managed to enter the uni of my choice. 

But looking back now, I was glad I hit a rock bottom that early in my life. It changed my perspective on many things, including on how I view academic grades, and that you should never let your goals be hindered by them. I have witnessed numerous friends and peers encountered their first rock bottom at a much later age and I notice the later the age, the harder it is to humble yourself and emerge from it stronger. 

The advice is simple. Even though you didn’t get your first choice in life, you have to go discover a second or  third choice to move on. 

Initially, you might resent and curse at the world or at yourself for having to settle for less.

But when the dust settles, more often than not, you will appreciate how doing the alternative forces you to become a better version of yourself who is hungrier at achieving your goal."
LingLingsGodma,7,"hi, reading your post sounds incredibly similar to how I felt a number of years ago when I got my A level results. Honestly speaking I hit rock bottom that year from Feb-Apr, and i’m sorry you’re feeling this way because I wouldn’t wish it on anyone. 

Right now you’re still feeling the sting of well… having the future that you always wanted sort of get ripped away from you, and unfortunately that is likely going to last for a while (I also had a number of conditional offers and also some unconditional US offers that cost way too much for me to go without a scholarship). 

What I can say is that it will get better! Time really does dull the pain 💛 And I worked really, really hard in uni because I knew I never wanted to feel like that again, and also because I knew that with consistently good uni results employers wouldn’t care about my A-level results as well. There’s still a future out there for you that can be great, just in a different way, as long as you work hard for it. You can also still apply for mid-term scholarships and scholarships for overseas exchanges if you manage to do well in uni, to offset costs. 

Despite the couple of years that have passed, there are times when I think about the ‘what-ifs’, especially when I go on Instagram and see my friends studying overseas living the life I’d always thought I would live. But it’s not something that I really hang onto now, because I’ve managed to do my best with what I have, and I love my degree that I would never have taken without being unable to meet my offers in the UK, and the new future that I can envision for myself. So there’s always a new path for you, that can make you just as happy, OP, even if you don’t see it now 🤍

And just a side note, I think sometime in June that year I followed a friend’s recommendation and used one of those websites to write a letter for my future self. And one year later I got the email and read it and - wow - the feelings I had had really changed by then. So hopefully that goes the same for you as well!"
OhShitBye,7,"Nah your feelings are valid. It's much better that you're up here complaining while still putting on face for your friends; lots of people wouldn't even have that kind of decency.

That being said, I fully understand where you're coming from. Understand that your friends all say the same stuff i.e. ""we're gonna fail paper too hard help la become hobo"" etc. Everyone does. Especially the smart ones.

I've never really been part of that crowd without well, dedicating my entire life to studying, much like I'm doing now in Uni. And even then I'm not amongst the top; I'm maybe somewhere in bronze tier. i.e. people are getting 90s or close to it for As, I got 81. It's a decent score by all means of course, but it's not what I worked for.

Regarding your results not matching your work, I feel you. It happens all the time, will continue to happen, and no amount of constructive feedback or analysis or whatever is going to make it feel better. It's about learning to take it in stride, even though it sucks ass. Come on here, rant a bit, rant to one of your friends, don't just let them always be happy (jk but not really, they're your friends for a reason. If you're there to support them, they should be there for you). Do what you gotta do to deal with it, and they should be helping you with it too.

And please remember, if you genuinely feel like this is constantly affecting you, or feel like this is crushing your self-esteem, please seek professional help. There is NO SHAME IN THAT. Let me repeat myself. NO SHAME IN THAT. Everyone needs help sometimes. Some of us can handle it ourselves, others can't. It doesn't make one better than the other; it just means that some of us are luckier to have better support systems (built in or obtained, either way luck)."
Dramatic_Rest7487,4,"Life is about looking ahead and moving forward.
Living in the past, 1) nothing's (your results) gonna change 2) you are only making yourself more miserable by wallowing in it."
tanteidaiko,3,"Hi, just want to know that I was also in a similar situation like yours. Tried applying to Med 3 times to no avail. So, instead had to choose a degree that relatively in the same industry, but not exactly what I want.

Similarly, I come from a not well to do family. So, I had to rely heavily on bursaries and financial aid. I went to NUS, and stayed in hall for the first year, so I know how the financial aid system work. If you stay in one of the halls in NUS, the financial aid actually helps subsidise a little of your hall fees. Not fully, but at least you dont need to pay fully. 

Additionally, the total busaries that I've gotten throughout my 4 years in NUS was essentially sufficient to fully pay my NUS school fees. But this is specific to my major, as well as for Singaporean's subsidised NUS school fee. So if you are in a similar situation, you dont have to worry about being in debt for school fees.

The only work you have to do now is to start saving up for your exchange, since there might not be extras from bursaries to cover your exchange costs."
kinggot,4,"Congrats my boy (or girl), you have now reached the peak finale. Your final education could very well end in uni and you still have yourself to prove academically in uni (its way tougher). But in the end, after you start working, grades or even the major you took may not matter.

Best of luck."
Toastwire,3,"I think you pretty much answered your own question. You've mentioned that you're someone who has placed much value in your academic performance as a way to define your self worth etc and it's good that you have realized that because the reality is that our country has groomed you up to have that sort of mindset. 

That you're all set in life just because you could regurgitate information on a single sheet of paper on a single sitting. 

I'm sure I'm not the only one to say that academics don't matter, I think at this point in your life you'll be able to see the reality of it. 

As an ex student who had always been the top few of my class, I used to have this impression that I was invincible or successful despite me not doing anything about my life. It was sort of a wake up call during my class reunion there after where my friends who did not perform well academically are now traders or stock brokers, some insurance agents , some a dance instructor and one became an airforce pilot.

Academics really don't matter, unless you're aiming for those government or medical jobs that require to see your cert, but even that only guarantees your starting pay. It's the way you handle projects and talk to people that make you climb up.

But then again not everyone wants to climb the corporate ladder as being high ranked doesn't guarantee a happy life either.
 
It's all up to you."
aparona,3,"Was also from ""top"" JC (got in through JAE), surrounded by friends who got 90RP and didn't do too well in 'A's myself (by my own standards, about 78.something if I recall correctly). Grad uni in a course I'm passionate about in 2021, currently a working adult in an unrelated industry.

Can't comment on everything but here's what I can offer my thoughts on:

1. Results not reflecting effort - get used to it, unfortunately this is going to happen a lot more over Uni and as you work :/ 
2. Once you get into uni, literally nobody will care about your 'A' level grades or what school you came from. You'll start to care less about that too. (I can't speak for med/law cause I've heard differently but that doesn't interest you anyway.)
3. Financing exchange - I think it depends. Again, can't speak for all but there will be scholarships and bursaries available. The bursary I got from NUS every year increased from 2.7k to 3.2k in 2020.   
Exchange bursary gave me 2.5k. Scholarship at exchange uni gave me the equivalent of 1k SGD/month while I was there. The scholarship was based on uni grades and I was at second upper on the border of first class honours at that point. I wouldn't say I was in dire financial straits but I received enough from the bursaries and scholarship to come back with more money than I brought with me when I left.

I'm not very empathetic, I don't know your entire situation, and we're probably quite different personality-wise so I'm sorry if I sound harsh - but have you looked at your options properly beyond catastrophizing about how your results are shattering your dreams? Chances are if you're willing to compromise on some things (e.g. hall, maybe), the world won't look like it's going to end."
RandomDude_-,5,"I know you did decently well so congrads. I understand your feeling. For my math prelim I was so confident about this math paper and I thought I could get a guaranteed 80+ atleast and perhaps even 85 while my friends were saying how the paper was so hard and they're screwed. I was shocked to see that I got 73 for the test and my friend who was complaining got 74 which wasn't that great of a score to him. 

I was just saying this to let you know that this feeling is common and of course i didn't act on my jealousy. Try your best to be happy for your friends and know that you did well too(probably above national mean)"

A level results isnt the end honestly I know people who did worse than me for A levels getting better Cap than me in uni. In the event that you cant get your dream course look into alternative and the possible job prospects honestly not everyone end up doing the job that’s related to their course so be more open minded in choosing the path that can lead you to your dream job. its not the end of the world
athousandpits,1,"so much of what we want does not seem possible, as blurry as it might seem, its best to let time run its course. The most crucial thing however is to not fall into despair or losing hope, some things would open up for better options or you'll land yourself better ideas on how to work things out. Surrendering and drowning yourself in helpless misery, although it might not be under your control, will only make everything seem darker. 

BELIEVING in what you want is the first step to anything. If things still move astray, know their is not just one path to what you want, the path what everybody else seems to be walking, might not be the one for you. 

academic validation is important, but A levels isn't your last time to prove yourself. and as long as you're sure you've worked hard, remember you can only get better from here. hang in there"

Firstly, no i don't believe employers check if you graduated later, they probably just care about your skills, portfolio and academic qualifications. Second, yes you should definitely switch courses if you don't like it, no point forcing yourself learning something you're probably never gonna use. Thirdly, for your mental health issues, people would recommend counsellers and you should do that if it helps you or maybe talk to your friends and family, but personally what worked for me is to just understand myself
Quick story, im an introvert, thought something was wrong with me since i dont talk to people much, went to counselling, counseller told me ""you can't keep living like this, something's wrong"", my mental health AND studies plummeted in the next few weeks when i was trying to things he said.

That's okay. We all dont necessarily always make the right decision - especially when in JC all we were focussed on are A Levels. There's still a lot of time to change, and also, your career doesn't really rely on what you study anymore

Are you taking core modules this semester? Since you are only in Y1 you should be taking mostly your major core modules and SMU Core modules, right? Which mods specifically are telling you that you don't like it?

>I've been thinking of taking a LOA for a sem after finishing this sem, but I'm not very sure what to do during that time, or whether I should even take the break.

I think that this is a good idea. It is not unheard of for students to change degrees after their first year. I have friends who did and are doing well now

I also have friends who have taken LOAs for their mental health. There is nothing wrong with this. But, I think that if you do choose to take an LOA, you need to come up with a plan to get your mental health back on track. There is no point taking an LOA if you're not going to make use of it

>Will/How will taking a LOA for mental health/getting my shit together affect my future, would employers see I took longer to grad and question me?

They might ask because they are curious, but it will not affect your chances 99% of the time. Case in point, one of my friends in SOL who took an LOA for mental health reasons recently got offered a training contract at a magic circle firm

>What should I do if I do decide to take a break? I'm not really sure what I should be doing to get my shit together, I've been taking a ""mental break"" for a long time now, kinda checked out of everything, so ""taking a break"" isn't really an option for a sem (it would make no difference bc I'm already kinda on break mode).

No. Checking out is different from getting things together. Sorry to say this - but things don't magically get better on their own most of the time. You can remove the main stressor in your life, but it does not mean you will automatically have a clear direction. You are also left reeling from its effects as well. It takes hard work, effort, and time for things to genuinely get better

I'd suggest seeing a therapist regularly and working with them on your mental health during your LOA. Would suggest getting one ASAP - right after exams before May even ends. Other than that, I'd also suggest figuring out what you actually want to do with your life. To do this, generally there are 3 steps

1. Figure out who you are. To do this, write things down, brainstorm, mindmap how you are feeling. Speak to people who know you like your friends and family if you have really no idea what you are interested in.
2. Figure out what out there fits within who you are. Read through all the SMU Course Handbooks to get a better idea of what is out there. Reach out to seniors through ask.SMU or Linkedin in different courses and ask them about what they are studying. Meet with career guidance counsellors in SMU. Speak to different CCAs about their industry and see if you are interested in it. There are a lot of resources available - use it
3. Make a decision, and head towards your goal

Point is - 8 months (May to December) is a lot of time to figure out what you want to do. You could take up a part-time job or something on the side for your daily needs. But with the rest of the time that you have you should figure yourself out as best as you can, then once you have done that, look at your options and plan the remaining of your uni life. It is very likely you will have to graduate at least a semester late if you take an LOA + change course

I'd strongly recommend seeing the Wellness Centre for more advice on this. They know what they are doing

&#x200B;

>Anyone have any info on taking LOA from SMU? I'm not too sure how it works, am I allowed to take for one sem or does it have to be an academic year? Will there be any records if I take one for mental health reasons?

You are allowed to take an LOA for one semester. You should check the SMU Website for more information, and Oasis for the proper process of taking an LOA.

I have done it - although not for mental health reasons. Many students do it for internships, its not unheard of nor is it uncommon. There is a student who took an LOA in Y1S1 so they could participate in a month-long programme in Japan

The only thing that will happen is that your transcript will show that you took an LOA during a semester. There is no reason given on your academic transcript. You'll be fine

So yes - please go and visit the Wellness Centre and Career Counsellors for help

I'd suggest dropping me a PM as well for more help - I regularly work with younger students on early stage ECG"
Professional-Elk737,1,"2 things that might help:

1) growth mindset. Your abilities aren’t fixed, you can work hard and improve your abilities. 
2) behavioral activation. Taking small actions can lead to a waterfall effect motivating you to take on larger actions. I used to think I would just wait for inspiration to strike to know what I wanted to do with my life, then I found the more I learned about random rabbit holes I’d go down on the internet the more I wanted to learned and became motivated to solve those problems. Take one step every day, could be going for a walk, doing the dishes, calling a friend. Read an article and if something in it makes you wonder, even a little, look it up and see where it takes you. With an open mind you can find where you’re headed!"
19-Feb-21,9,Tuition. Hire people who aren't afraid to tell you how much you suck. It helps to maintain a low self-esteem. All the best
Transparisteele,8,"My judgement about this as a working adult with a not-so-stellar A level result is that if you can’t yet find the motivation to do it yourself, tuition is incredible at maintaining your focus. They will drill you until the facts get into your mind. 

The other alternative is to drill yourself nonstop. Every day, set a schedule for yourself and tell yourself I commit to a minimum of the 4 hours of proper studying, and that you validate your knowledge by doing an assessment without cheating by memorizing answers. 

Then it’s endless drilling for the ten years series, over two months, repeatedly as many times as you can if you want the highest possible rank points. 

Now, if you managed to enter a “Good JC” you have to ask yourself in the two years between O and A levels how has your focus changed? Did you meet someone who distracted you romantically? Did you begin to experience changes to your personality due to the new environment and academic demands? I would suggest that you seem to be fairly motivated and focused in your writing, so perhaps the distraction is gone since you took the A levels.

Finally, if your grades are acceptable (able to find placement into a decent university course) is it worth it to push for the additional year to try to get the coveted law/medicine/cs degree that you think you want? What is it you’re trying to aim for and how absolutely certain it is something you personally deep down desire, and it isn’t something someone else is pushing you to do? 

Because after A levels comes another 3/4 years of schooling at least in university where the same questions of motivation and drive will settle in again. I’m not saying this to discourage, but rather to make certain that whatever path you choose, you are aware that it takes sacrifice and great willpower to succeed. Tuition is just good enough for this year, but university has few to no tuition resources. 

Best of luck."

clandestineoperation,6,"J3 here who got an SMU Law offer through early admissions (did not apply to NUS law so I can’t speak for that). There really is no way to prepare for the written test - expect to do something like GP AQ, or ELL if you’ve taken the subject in JC. If you’re really law material you’ll enjoy doing the test. Best advice I can give you is to have a good night’s sleep before so you can tackle it to the best of your abilities. For the SMU law interview a huge segment of it is testing your ability to formulate and communicate your views and opinions on current affairs, so you might want to read up on broad issues that concern Singapore. At the end of the day you’ll want to showcase confidence in your opinions (but also open-mindedness and a willingness to change if you’re wrong), being observant and analytical. All the best!"

avocadohater3000,81,You could start by not informing teachers/parents of every small detail students share with you. No one trusts school counsellors anymore.
HedgehogMost5145,34,"I dont have anything you can apply but i went to counselling ONCE. And regretted it ever since because i felt like it didnt help me at all, the lesson i learnt is i know myself the best, so i would know the solutions to the problems i have. If i really had to suggest something, id say try to help students understand themselves instead of giving a solution. Of course i dont have a degree in psychology but i feel like if a solution doesnt work, the student will feel like they're back to square 1. Maybe give them something permanent, not something temporary. Something that will last throughout their lives. And of course, i think you should listen and never think you understand the students fully because i dont think anyone can understand someone completely unless they've lived through every second of their lives and felt the exact emotions they felt"
reiiichan,32,"why do counsellors think that telling parents things that we've shared in confidentiality and specifically told them not to tell our parents is a good idea? 

one of my friends came out to the school counsellor in their school but begged the counsellor not to tell their parents because they knew their parents were homophobic. the counsellor told their parents anyway and my friend was punished by their parents as a result. now they have to constantly pretend that they are ""straight again"" and it's taking a toll on their mental health

not the same thing but personally, i told the counsellor at my previous school about how my mother broke my finger out of anger and without warning me, the counsellor escalated the matter to my form teacher and the principal without letting me know first. the counsellor knew beforehand that my mother was prone to fits of anger and had previously hurt my siblings and i, albeit to a less serious degree

i only found out that the principal was even involved when my furious mother called me up to ask why she had to see the principal and scolded me for ""letting outsiders poke their nose into our family affairs"" and it caused me a lot of stress and anxiousness. i returned home terrified everyday for several weeks afterwards bc i was worried about incurring my mother's wrath

i get that perhaps the counsellor was worried about me and wanted to make sure i wouldn't get hurt again, but i would have much preferred that they let me know what course of action they were going to take so i could mentally prepare myself, or perhaps even involve me in the decision making process so i could have perhaps done something that would have made my mother less angry"
zeafver,19,"Counsellors who aren't political, for starters why do counsellors have to report to police?"
SongTheGoat,8,I opened up to my school counsellor once and after that somehow my parents and every teacher in the school knew about the info I shared. Never trusted a counsellor again and told peers not to as well. I think you know what my suggestion to you would be.
halcyondays13,7,"From what I gathered from friends who went to school counsellors plus my one and only time going, perhaps start by treating us as humans and not a problem to solve. 

Also, if a student is of legal age, confidentiality shouldn’t be broken (even to parents) unless there is an imminent threat of harm/mandated reporting. Just because we are in a school setting does not mean that we don’t have the rights to confidentiality."
kpopandanimetrash,5,"I feel like this might not be a valid take cause I didn't go to meet a school counsellor, had mine with a msw outside. So my knowledge of school counsellor and the things my friends said is what I heard, at least the negatives. But I'll say I think this can apply to pretty much students view adults in their life and I think it's good to take note.

That most students you'll probably deal with are age range of primary, secondary and tertiary kids. And I'll a pit fall adults tend to view, especially the latter 2 category is that they're too young and need intense cuddling to solve all problems, or have the capabilities of a full grown adult or even more to solve their and understand their issues. Truth be told, these people are actually more or less somewhere in between. They can understand things, especially the older students slowly learning more about how the adult world works, and some more than their peers. But ultimately, there's a reason they come to you, the counselor, and it's that they're still too young to know how to handle everything.

Hell even adults struggle with stress, but what more to a kid where everything is magnified. Like they still learning, and in the midst of the chaotic world they're trying to navigate, they need guidance. And I think as a counselor it'll be good to offer them, and I emphasis *guidance*. Don't false promise you can help them, but don't make it sound like you're abandoning them. Cause the last thing they need is to feel alone, cause I can see how most of these people just don't have a figure to look to, maybe aside from friends but these friends are also young too. Hence they want this adult figure to depend on, basically like the extra parental figure.

So yeah, idk if this makes sense but I'll say go into this mindset that they're a person. They're viewing a world in innocent but are also dreadful of it. So it'll be good to guide them through this and make them see the world just... A world, yes it's cruel and tough but they can find a way and actually will, and won't definitely be alone in this journey.

But yeah the exact phrasing and how to do so, I'll say you gotta also experience and learn yourself. You haven't actually started yet and I think you really gotta experience to really see and realise a lot of these things. Cause you're human too and you're still young and can go grow, so I guess take in mind that just as you are learning things, so are the students"
biskwy,4,"I think the issue is a systemic one rather than what an individual counsellor can achieve. Mental health stigma is still so deeply embedded within the Asian community that it transpires into even the young ones. Going to the counsellor is seen as almost as taboo rather than self-empowering. 

It isn't wrong for a counsellor to report that a 14 year old is suicidal. It isn't wrong for the 14 year old to feel that way too. But the main conflict arises from the shame and guilt of the suicidal tendencies being ""exposed"" when in fact that is probably the most important thing to free oneself from mental trauma. It is to acknowledge it, not repress it. 

It is to talk and heal about it, but understand that not everyone around the individual has the resources to maturely deal with it too. 

So what can YOU do? You can for one start by changing the system. You cannot change Singapore but you can begin with changing the school. Rarely what you do on an individual one-to-one session will really make an impact on a systemic level. So start with the school. Address the stigma that going to the counsellor is not a sign of weakness. 

Counsellors exist is a difficult spot because they are ill equipped to deal with mentally ill students who require more professional support. But it is these students that are the most stigmatized."

YoungAspie,2,">I got PTSD from nursing bc of bad experiences during attachments

Every job has its unpleasant parts. The true test of passion for a job is the ability to handle its unpleasant parts. Attachments, like internships, are supposed to expose you to the real job, including its unpleasant parts. If you hate attachments, consider whether your bad experiences are representative of the unpleasant parts of nursing and whether nursing really suits you. All the best!"
ireallyhatedriving15,2,"You don't seem to have much career direction. Because if your end goal is polyclinic, there's no point in taking a degree or even an advance diploma.

2. Depends on the job role that you're applying, if you apply for some generic business analyst role, you'll be competing with a larger pool of candidates, whereas if you pick something more techhnical and specialized in data analytics, less competition.
3. No, InfoSec has so many sub-fields that you can specialize in.
4. Just because you graduate with X degree doesn't mean you're locked into X industry for life.  Tons of people are working in jobs that aren't remotely related to their degree.
5. Theres no 'safer' option. Go with whichever interests you more.

Overall both degrees are tech related, you can apply for any tech related job if you have the knowledge and skills required for it. Good employers look at your portfolio and internship experience as well. I have friends whose first jobs aren't related to their degree, so even if you lose interest in your degree, you can still look at other industries."

cai_tao_kueh,4,"for pure chem/phy, it's all about *fully* understanding the concepts for every chapter, and ensuring that you have sufficient practice. try to do more topical worksheets based on the chapters that you are weak on, and you can ask your tutor to focus more on the topics that you're struggling with. there are certain topics like moles that are very essential come the o levels, so you must make sure that you master the relatively easier topics before you head on to the more complicated ones. don't rush.

for humanities (idk which elective you're taking so ill only give you tips for ss) for social studies, it is important to check the news every day and categorise them based on the chapters you have learn in your tb (eg. malaysia chicken export ban - economic/cultural issues for sg?) for sbq, you must master the formats and start timing yourself for every practice paper you do, as you must manage your time wisely during the examinations. you need to think faster, write faster.

for amaths/emaths, same as the sciences. do more practices and focus more on mastering the easy topics. if you need help, ask your teachers and friends to slowly go through with you, step by step. my dms are open to any questions, just message me if you have any clarifications)

for english, one noticeable sign lies in your sentence structure. try to write more compositions and take some time to create and develop a vocabulary bank. for oral, you must watch more news, dive deeper into certain topics to aid you in your spoken interaction. notice how the speaker expresses himself and use articulate body motions to not sound monotonous. if possible, figure out the main points and how the speaker rebuts any counter-argument. for comprehension/listening comprehension, do more practice (especially your summary) and let your teacher mark. during the holidays, it would be beneficial for you to do more practice papers, to develop your comprehension skills and learn to answer the question.

tbh, i cant tell you what to do or not do, but you can try different methods of studying and see which one benefits you the most and stimulates yourself to be more productive and focused. you should take this time to enjoy the year as well, because sec 4 is the time where you'll feel demoralised over the workload you'll receive. try to make more lifelong friends as well, while trying to manage you work-life balance and physical/mental wellbeing

all the best!"

okayyyyytt,1,dmed !

Not saying u can’t go Jc ) because there are success stories whr sec 5 students made it to JC but u rlly have to work extremely hard. For my case, I did put in a lot effort in my sec 5 year and my results still wasn’t ideal. I personally feel even though udk what ur interested in right now ( like me that time ) , u shld still go for EAE as a back up. Do up a good portfolio and ace the interview.

Ktmatcha,1,You may want to consider doing your NS first. My view is that you do not know what to do with your life right now. And it is not uncommon. What you need is to see the real world out there and how you want to be part of it. Working is one way too.

zeemouu,73,"okay i dont mean to go in deeper than this rly is but
a lot of tech nowdays are made to just work well for a short period of time instead of work long term. 

like for example lightbulbs. current lightbulbs last about 2000 hours. thing is they lasted about the same in the 1920s. then lightbulb manufacturers had a secret meeting in 1924 in geneva where they discussed how longer lasting lightbulbs was causing loss of profit as people had to buy them less often. so they stopped trying to increase the longevity of lightbulbs.

most tech followed this . calculators are only suprising bcs they are one of the few tech that didnt. they could have easily had 1200 nits brightness oled foldable screens but they decided to not do so. now, long lasting calculators are the norm so its very hard for calculator manufacturers to try and decrease the longevity of calculators."

math_dydx,4,"1. No. Over the past few years (link below), the IGP for NTU Accountancy VS NTU Business, business changes to become more favourable than accountancy already. Across NTU/NUS/SMU, there is a significant drop in accountancy students intake while an increase in business students intake. It seems to point to the shrinking need for accountants and the accounting industry. Seems that students are gradually shifting from accountancy to business.
2. Yes. Just last night I saw on an Instagram story of my NTU Accountancy friend who went to be an accountant dreading his job and his Sunday overtime work. I have friends who start off as accountants in their first few years after graduation, now already switch to non-accountancy jobs already. So what's the point of doing accountancy if so many people (high chance) gonna switch to other jobs? As well just do a business degree right from the beginning.
3. \-
4. \-
5. I have seen quite a couple of Reddit post in r/NTU where people ask if can change from accountancy to business. Almost never see any post that wants to change from business to accountancy.

[https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1MPEDZpw26TjN7dTsQzsbnXHZa47og0qSrdHrlT7nLKc/pubhtml#](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1MPEDZpw26TjN7dTsQzsbnXHZa47og0qSrdHrlT7nLKc/pubhtml#) 

And, also note the drastic drop in NTU/NUS/SMU Accountancy/Business degree IGP by 5 to 10 RP within less than 10 years.

The accountancy industry is not as stable as many might have thought. It is stable in the past decades, which is why many parents will encourage their children to do an accountancy degree. But how about the future in the world of data science and AI ? There are really a lot of accountants out there already, competing with private uni accountancy graduates as well. And I am sure you have heard of the horrors of accountants working long hours and being underpaid, which is quite true as my accountancy peers are slogging away when I see their Instagram posts. Moreover, if you look at the cut-off points for accountancy/business across NTU/NUS over the past 10 years, you will see there is a downward trend in the 10th percentile cut-off. Especially NTU accountancy/business have dropped more than 10 rank points in less than 10 years. In fact, the landscape of accountancy jobs is rapidly changing in the current technological age. And the stability of accountancy jobs in the next decades is really questionable. Thus, it doesn't mean accountancy jobs will be very stable and good money in the long run. That is why many business schools are pivoting to include more technical stuff. If you look at what NTU accountancy is doing recently, they recently introduced NTU accountancy with a minor in digitalisation and data analytics (DDA). This shows that they are trying to include more analytics in their degree which currently they are lacking in the technical aspects. But honestly, a minor is just 4 to 5 modules, which cannot be compared to the statistical data analytics skills training in a math/stats/datasci degree. Compsci and engineering will even be better trained in dealing with data analytics and AI compared to accountancy/business.  
  
The accounting industry is indeed undergoing a lot of changes and even business schools are pushing to include more coding and data analytics modules in their curriculum. They are rebranding themselves to make themselves more focused on analytics. This change can be seen in all the business schools trying to jump onto the bandwagon of compsci hype when they knew their original curriculum don't have much coding and data analytics that employers are looking for nowadays.  
  
There are stories of people regretting joining accountancy. The reality is that many people blindly pursue accountancy/business, without actually knowing what accountancy/business curriculum entails, and without actually knowing how the current technological era is revolutionising many industries (including the accountancy industry). Many enter business school for the so-called ""prestige"", ""stability"", ""money"" without assessing if he/she is really interested and have the aptitude in it. That is why they regretted taking accountancy degree.  
  
How will the accountancy industry change in the near future? Everyone knows how compsci was so unpopular back then, just less than 10 years ago. And now? Compsci shot up in popularity. Nobody can predict what is going to happen next.  
  
Thus, it is essential for you to find a degree that capitalise on your strengths and interest. Blindly following the current crowd and pursuing a so-called ""elite"" degree or degree that promises ""lots of money"" is very risky and may lead to major regrets in the future when you lost the drive to work hard because of your lack of interest in the degree/field you chose."
Hackzx_,2,"(1) For IB, your internship experience and your ability to pass case interviews etc. are far more important.

Biz ad with finance specialisation will be sufficient for IB. Not to discourage you but IB is very competitive and not everyone can get in, so accountancy does give you an additional backup option.

(2) Depends from person to person and his/her interests

(3) Also depends on what are your career plans and what you want to get out of your education.

(4) Accountancy with specialisation in finance is quite common. You are basically using your unrestricted electives to take finance modules (instead of using them to take another minor or taking interesting modules outside of biz etc.). Whether it is difficult or not is subjective, everyone has different capabilities.

(5) Not very common, but have definitely seen quite a few of my peers do so"
Jump_Hop_Step,1,I think there is a thread in the NTU subreddit about your query. Which second major program did you apply for and why this change?
ireallyhatedriving15,9,"In university, they are looking at your general physical health for example: if they need to cater to certain disabilities (wheelchair-access if you are using PMDs, extra time in exams if you have any learning disabilities), or grant you more allowable MCs, lateness and special arrangement for exam timetable (if you have chronic disease where you need to have ongoing check-ups). There are also some course where you may not be allowed if you have certain conditions (certain degree of colour blindness or certain myopia level).

They aren't allowed to look down on you just because you have ""certain"" conditions as it's against the law and they have to make special arrangements from you,

That's for physical conditions. I assume your parents has this stigma because your condition is more ""mental""... Technically by right they aren't suppose to discriminate (since it's illegal)

&#x200B;

... by left, i'm actually not too sure. I suppose they might take in other applicants with the same calibre but no condition because of the med school rigour. I'm not really sure since it's highly illegal to discriminate."
Paccountorncorn,1,generally no
Mysterious-Tie3291,1,"Might be interested, can dm me details? Thx :p"
Own-Bake-4687,3,"It’s not really that hard. You do not need motivation, nor screen time limit, and i actually dont really support having screen time limit. Reason being that you yourself should be self disciplined and control your own usage on social media/games, not relying on others to control you. If you restrict yourself voluntarily and do your work, i think that would be better for yourself as a whole. As before doing that you have to fully understand why using phone at that point of time is not needed and that you have other urgent priorities, like tell yourself: what’s the point of social media and games?? Not like you can’t survive without it. Once you have eliminated those distractions, you need to do your homework on time, frequently clarify your doubts(do not wait until WA period. Clarify it there and then.) and of course revise what you’ve learnt. However, i feel there’s no need to revise even 1 hour everyday. I feel like you could pick like any free day you want of the week and dedicate like 2 hours (anyth uw)of that day to consolidate your week’s learning and go through your mistakes etc etc. Important thing is, don’t rely on motivation, you have to be disciplined. Think about how you would react if all of your classmates went to good post secondary routes and you have no choice but to retake or pick a course you don’t like. Think about the faces of the people who believed in you: teachers parents friends etc. To be honest, what really matters is your mindset. If you really want something just do it, don’t think twice about “oh, what if all these hard work will not pay off and i’m just stupid” Well, unless you have below average IQ or something your results will reflect your hard work. At this point, drop your ego and just work hard. (why i’m saying this: sometimes you think you know something but you actually don’t, however you’re scared others will judge you or anything…whatever. It doesn’t matter what you went through to achieve outstanding results. Some people are just naturally smarter and that’s because they won the genetic lottery/fate. Yeah, i don’t get how people brag about being smart, it’s not even something that you have earned, you were given the intelligence since you were born.) Anyway, all the best OP! Also a fellow S3 student who’s a procastinator. Can somehow can give advice but cannot take actions himself. Bye!"
Available-Cancel5993,2,"Haha same bro I can totally relate. I barely studied from start of sec 3 to my sec 4 prelims, always slack and play games. Also had a short attention span so I cannot focus for long. What I did was I split my work up into many parts, e.g math, each time do about 3-4qns, same for history, do 1 seq then rest for Abt 10 mins. Doing something is always better than doing nothing at all. Another important thing that I did was go library study. Environment there very nice, quiet, and when u there, everyone around u study also so u feel the urge to study ( this really helped to keep me in check )

I basically did this from prelim onwards cuz my marks were so ass it was a wake up call (l1r4 30)

Then o level come out I also dk how my l1r4 raw was 12 LOL!!

GloxyVI,1,">Will/How will taking a LOA for mental health/getting my shit together affect my future, would employers see I took longer to grad and question me?  


Nobody is going to care. You don't write your age on your resume do you?

>What should I do if I do decide to take a break? I'm not really sure what I should be doing to get my shit together, I've been taking a ""mental break"" for a long time now, kinda checked out of everything, so ""taking a break"" isn't really an option for a sem (it would make no difference bc I'm already kinda on break mode).  


Try out skills. That's why its called ""Goods & Services"". Either you learn to make a product like SWE or you provide a service like data analysts. Try a variety of skills, go for internships if you want and find something you remotely are alright with.

justvibin-1,4,"Hihi I’ve been applying for the scholarships and here’s what I know:

Yes you have to contact your teachers. I contacted my teachers to write my referral letters beforehand to ask if they’d be willing because there is a high chance that some teachers might be busy with work or simply dont feel like they know you enough to write your referrals. NUS provided a scholarship referral information sheet which you can find online and send to the teachers as it contains all the information they will need!

https://nus.edu.sg/oam/docs/default-source/scholarship/nus_scholarships_referee_information_sheet#:~:text=The%20referee%20report%20is%20to,as%20indicated%20by%20the%20applicant.



The other documents refers to any relevant documents to the achievements that you will submit, certificates for competitions or pre-tertiary scholarships, work records if you mentioned relevant internships or work experiences. 

NUS didn’t include a personal statements section for scholarships but you can choose to alter the answers to the short answer questions for general applications so that they pertain more to the skills and traits you would like to display for your scholarship applications."

Ok-Boot9744,3,Honestly get used to it. Your teachers just don't know what goes on behind the scenes. These kind of things happen more than you can imagine. Most people just don't get caught only. Not even just with neighbourhood schools. Even the prestigious ones like IP schools all have cases. They just smarter about not getting caught. Plus the prestigious schools are stricter; people get expelled easily over there for having relationships/vices so they can keep their reputation. From what I can tell you're probably from lower secondary but don't be surprised these kinds of things can get more common the higher you go as people get more comfortable sharing stuff and also get closer to the legal age.
inverse2000,3,"Well, in my secondary school, the police turning up was a biweekly occurrence. The toilets were always full of cigarette butts. At one point, we were not allowed to use non rubber-covered bicycle locks (to lock our bikes in schools) as too many students were using bike chains as weapons.

now that i have physically “glowed up” but no longer have that confidence i don’t think i’ve ever been as attractive as i was back then.
what really matters most is how comfortable and proud you are as yourself (even if it’s unwarranted confidence)"
sakuradelluna,28,...you guys are having glow-ups?
Hot_Contribution3828,42,"I knew someone who kinda had a glow up in upper sec. Initially not much changed. But when she went poly, she found it a lot easier to make friends. Even the popular clique, some of them approached her and she inadvertently found herself become part of the clique LOL. The popz clique in our sec sch definitely didn't see her as equals...

By ""approach"" they prob mean same gender approaching them to be friends. If opp gender I agree it's prob exaggerated.

It's when you go to a new environment when things will be drastically different. The first impression others have of you is very important."
hewwoitzmeeee,37,not a mega glow up but a decent one - stopped getting comments about how big my arms were (ok still hv but in a diff way bc im more muscular now so its a good thing) and i occasionally get told that i look good/ shop workers say i suit a dress/ ppl tell me i suit what im wearing when ive never been told that in the past. instead of “stop eating so much” its “how do u stay like that and eat so much?”
cai_tao_kueh,97,"ok, so let's just start with the realistic, yet hard truth about myself.

to my peers, i may have a somewhat kind and cheerful personality, but i look really ugly im appearance. ever since the ""sigma"" meme started, all the handsome dudes could master this trend and gain countless number of likes on their social media platforms.

however, as BeReal has taught me, nothing is more important than being yourself. no need to impress everybody, but yourself.

i used to have a crush on a cute girl since sec 2, however i literally changed my whole personality merely because of fantasizing over one girl. i tried to act more cool and be more ""aggressive"" as a person. usually, i don't push myself too much, but it came to the point where i took many unnecessary risks, such as asking her out when we just started becoming friends and asking many uncomfortable questions like ""how would you feel if you dated me?"" in fact, i nearly plotted on stalking her because i could not control my jar of emotions. i know i'm gonna get a lot of criticism here because i don't respect others' privacy. i admit to it right here, right now. i was an imbecile. a maniac who can't even pull girls despite all of my ""hard work"". a complete sore loser.

after a while, she left my friend group, and what seemed to be a moment of despair, turned out to become a blessing in disguise. once she left, I admitted defeat in not being able to talk to her anymore, so I slowly changed back to my own self. I did what I loved, such as talking to my juniors and seniors both online and irl, continuing being the ""math whizz"" as my classmates continue to tease me on, and even found my love for an NBA basketball team - the Golden State Warriors. i continued to make more friends, and even hung out with them physically several times! it was a wonderful experience, and their presence is something money cannot buy.

i could finally find what i have truly loved, not because of a girl, but because of satisfying nobody but myself.

the ugly duckling might eventually turn out into a beautiful swan, but to me, I'd rather be an ugly duckling - to let my nasty looks humble me and explore this world to discover what I truly love."
solariiis,14,(my own ratings) i went from a 1 to a 5 and some people noticeably treated me better/were more willing to associate with me. not much other than that.
aThrowaway2006xX,9,Not really a glow up but I have become significantly more talkative and involved in my JC class compared to my secondary school class.
LogAdditional7893,7,"in lower sec i was fat and no one really noticed me. My friend group was the sort of ""loner/weird"" guys and the popular ppl always picked on me and my friend group. But in late sec 3 to early sec 4, i had slimmed down q a lot and gained q a a bit of muscle so ig that was my glow up? but anyways after i slim down then more people were talking to me and the popular ppl were all being nice to me. i got into more friend groups and all of them were sort of the popular ppl. didnt get a gf tho :(  glow ups arent about how you look but probably about your ability to converse with someone or having confidence. still working on that talking with other people part since i am very introverted. hopefully by the time poly starts i will not be afraid to talk to ppl"
One-Complaint-3998,3,"not a huge glowup but i’d say my looks changed pretty drastically since sec school (am a dude)

things that changed:
- more compliments from friends and relatives about my looks
- some other dudes seem more aggressive towards me as if i owe them something (rare but happens. sometimes i tend to feel that way too towards guys more good looking than me lols, probs jealousy or insecurity)
- people are much friendlier towards me, other than the aggressive dudes. also i feel more confident when approaching others and making friends
- more peaks and glances from the opposite sex (im not super handsome but last time they dont even bother looking at me)
- girls actually approached to talk to me and hang out with me, but super rare though like only 2-3 in 5-6 years span
- i just feel like i got more confidence to do whatever i want in public lol, like yawn loudly or do some weird shit hahaha and i wont be as afraid of getting judged

im pretty hyper aware of these changes because i fully understand how superficial this society is and i want to constantly remind myself not to treat good-looking and not-as-good-looking people differently. hope this helps"
Kweknation,3,"Tldr: Looks help alot, but won’t make up for poor social skills.

In army, I used my free time to hit the gym and my acne began to clear up. Spent my allowance on getting better haircuts, dressing better and buying contacts.

Entering into uni I definitely noticed a difference between how I was treated in JC orientation vs Uni orientation. Not just in terms of romantic interests, but even just people jio-ing for stuff/how people talk to me/starting convos. When it came to romance, I did have more opportunities with people I was attracted to. Sadly, having grown up “ugly”, I didn’t have the social skills to make the most of those opportunities. Learned the hardway till the end of uni when I finally got together with my current gf and we’re in a really good relationship."
phantazy1004,2,"For me, I was considered ugly pre poly (buck teeth, full of acnes etc). I went to poly, took off my braces, cleared my acnes and spiked my hair up (the hairstyle that best suits my face, esp when my face shape and nose are long). Then, I started getting comments like “cute” “handsome” esp from older women. 10 years later, I still get the same comments from older women but younger women do not seem to care. The world is weird

Some guys also seem to dislike me from the get go, but I never have this issue with women"
human5158,2,"I'd say the biggest benefit is how much more tolerant people are of bold and daring behaviours. less good looking people are expected to be lowkey and normal, and if they do something unorthodox its 'attention seeking' or 'extra' but good looking people doing something strange and new would be considered 'thinking out of the box' and 'creative'

other than that i guess the normal pretty priviledges like getting help and attention more easily, being prioritised or get more lenient treatment. 

source: looked pretty ok in primary school by teacher's standards at least, gained lot of weight in lower sec and bad skin, then in upper sec lost weight around my face and braces plus proper skincare, now gets hit on maybe once or twice a year and constantly approached by elderly for help because I 'look kindhearted'"

RacistQuokka,1,"I had a glow up in my JC years, lost some fat and put on muscle + actually started to groom myself. People would call me handsome etc. and I noticed a difference in the way people treated me, but I really attribute it to me being able to carry myself better around others and coming off as more confident. While pretty privilege is definitely a thing I think it's role is overstated in your typical glow up story. More self confidence and respect is ultimately the fundamental cause of differences in your daily interactions, and imo a glow up is just one of the (more common) ways people attain that."

Stop dreaming. Start working first..."
randyed,6,"hey op, i think it’s good that you have a goal in mind before poly starts. recently, 2 nursing grads made it to nus yllsom after finishing poly so it is possible :) nursing would be hospital attachments especially in the wards while biomed would mostly be in the labs (nil ward exposure i think)! so i believe its best to stick to nursing so you can explore even more if you truly want to be a doctor or a nurse. plus i think a good chunk of the content from nursing would overlap with medicine so its much better to be in nursing first than biomed. unless you really like research/laboratory work then it would be biomed — but even then all med school students go through the medical ward rotations first before specialising into lab/research…atb! 

edit: btw, you would be able to apply to study straight after getting a nursing diploma at nus yll or ntu lkc as it is an acceptable diploma. the only exception is ntu requires applicants to sit for the BMAT as of now (not sure after the restructuring of ntu med in the future) while nus doesn’t need any additional tests. duke-nus will take a while to become a dr as students will study a different undergraduate degree then go on to the MD graduate program (3-4+4 years). nus & ntu is a 5 year undergraduate degree."
TchaikovskyAgain,11,"I don't have advice for you, but my late mum's experience with nurses.

My mum's health was quite bad over her life as she suffered from diabetes and kidney failure. Towards the end, she always talked about how much she respected the nurses because it must be hard to come to work everyday to wipe strangers' butts and clean up after them. One of my friends who THOUGHT she wanted to be a nurse broke down crying at the prospect of having to clean someone's rear. Plus all the blood and needles. It really isn't for the weak hearted.

If you're passionate about helping people through their pain, I think nursing would be great honestly. Doctors really only see their patients once or twice a day in inpatient settings and even longer stretches for outpatient and gp. You will rarely get to observe their individual progress unless it's a long lasting illness or they come back for check up."
Ktmatcha,6,You said you are very interested in human and animal biology. It seems to me that a research or science related path might be more suitable. Nursing or being a doctor are caring professions. Do you also have a heart for other people’s well-being? That’s the question you may want to ask yourself.
Status_Yellow_4649,5,"I think it might be better to go through the jc route if you want to go medicine as getting 4.0 every semester is super hard esp when there are factors that may affect your grades that are out of your control. 

Having said that please research what it means to be a doctor before making a decision. It may be a prestigious job title but it is an exhausting job with long working hours, ultimately it boils down to passion and commitment to stay in the job. 

You can check out this youtuber: Ali Abdaal, a former doctor now youtuber. He gives insights about medicine as a career."
lauises,4,"Don't fall into the trap of thinking you can only be happy with one of these paths, and not the other. It's great that you found an interest in healthcare. Sure, each path has its pros and cons. But it's helpful to keep your own on the bigger picture of healthcare work in general. 

Try for being a doctor, sure. Continue the path for nursing, that's great too. A friend worked for a few years as a nurse, then decided to pursue medicine at Duke-NUS and is now a doctor. 

Preferring something else doesn't mean the choice you have just made is a 'wrong choice'."
pussioblud,4,"If you stick to nursing, you would have ward exposure and prior experience as compared to being in biomed.

More job opportunities too rather than working in a lab."
pussioblud,3,"There is this guy from sg that got into medicine amd he give the best advice (personally i think so) when it comes to applying for medicine and i really knew it.

Opposite_Royal5125,2,"Hello , actually it's still possible to be a doctor after u studied nursing, but the road wont be an easy one definitely. I remember there was a pharmacy technician (those that dispense medicines for you at pharmacy at hospitals) that came to my school for ECG cafe sharing. In his sharing someone asked if it was possible to pursue medicine after studying pharmacy technician related courses in poly. He said it was possible as he heard of stories of ppl being successful in it. In fact his friend who was a nurse in kk women and children hospital actually studied nursing and worked for some time as a nurse before applying to go for medicine to be a doctor! But he also shared that the journey wasn't easy so you really need to be determined to do it. 

Personally, i would suggest you dont DAE as the chances of DAE being successful is highest at RP. From my knowledge, SP doesnt offer DAE to students unless they have other qualifications, or they are from other poly. This itself already greatly reduce your chance to enter medicine in a local uni. 

Ultimately, the decision is yours but think through properly b4 making the decision as it will affect ur life and ur future. 

Hope this helps!"
ytolololol,2,"Hi OP, realise that this might sound really harsh but its reality. Im not trying to bring your hopes down or anything, but just to do a reality check. Since you mentioned in an earlier comment you didnt mimd the hours sure, lets skip that part. Lets just focus on getting there first.

The number of poly graduates entering medicine school (mostly from biomed sci, with few exceptions of nursing, pharm sci, and theoratically biomed eng into ntu med but i have heard 0 success cases so far) is a very small number. Like maybe 20-30 max each year from all polys. (I think, could be more? Idk.) Who you will be competing with to gain entrance into medical school. This number is at most maybe 5-10% of all med sch students in both nus yong loo lin sch of medicine, and ntu lee kong chian sch of medicine. You will be competing with the rest of the applicants who will take up 95% of the applicants.... who (these are just stats i recall off online, compiled, in sg context, not overseas context.)

Avg 2000+ applicants to NUS medicine. NTU medicine im not too sure, still relatively new, but i believe not too far off. Mostly 90 rank pointers, even if they arent, they have stellar portfolios to back them up with probably, hospital internship experiences as well as job shadowing. Only 250-280 get accepted for NUS (since im alr taking out poly grad number) (Stats from lowkeymedic) (https://thelowkeymedic.com/singapore-medicine-application-guide/?v=0f177369a3b7) 

Me and a bunch of other peeps did the math before, the number of 90 rps in sg number around 10-20% of the popn (we put it safely at approx 15% ish, considering hci, ri, vjc, nyjc, etc.). Not all of these people will apply for medicine. And even among those who do, its basically only top 10% who get accepted. Or if i would rephrase.... you will be competing with the top 10% of jc people who has alr topped national exams, and who has topped entire national exams from o level or psle time.... which means you are competing to gain entrance into medicine with essentially the top 0.45% of population of sg roughly? If we factor in NTU medicine, maybe closer to top 1%? Oh ya, then lets throw in the fact that uni admissions especially for medicine is alr naturally skewed in uhm, jc students favour, so you would be fighting an even harder battle. 

Look, this isnt me trying to make people gain depression or shit. Reality is harsh. But if you are ready and willing to put in the work and effort, with the passion still alive even after being put through the wringer in nursing, graduating with a stellar portfolio and 3.9+ gpa, you definitely have a shot. Go for it. Even if you end up not going into medicine, but still want to, theres always the option of duke-NUS MD. Theres even pathways to reach there even from undergrad, with the specialised sutd-duke nus or smu-duke nus pathway. Go for it. We will be rooting for you! :) Considering you are at your age of i presume, 17, and found the path you want this early on, it already puts you ahead of many people. For example; it took me 22 years before i realised what i wanted to do in my life. Lmao. Jiayous!!!"
ivygraduate,2,"not sure how poly works, but i do know that getting into med in uni is super competitive and you’d need the grades for that. because you said you can qualify for a low tier jc, if you have the means and are willing, do the ib in an international school. sure, it’s not acs indep or hci, but it’s still going to allow you to do the ib programme. 

the ib is structured a little different compared to the usual a levels and i feel like you’d prob fair well in ib. it’s also relatively easier to score high and will land u a spot in nus med or whatever uni you’re aiming for. 

i know this isn’t what you planned on doing, but it’s something for you to consider if you’re able to spend 35-50k for the next 2 years. you’ll need to work even harder than you did for o levels if you want to get into med school. can’t comment on dae, have no clue what that is

Zealousideal_Tax8255,58,"wow ok I've never actually heard abt toxic env in nj (usual bad things are pw and old facilities but that's it)... let me share my thoughts on this :D part of nj alumni btw 

I always liked my environment in nj and thought it was kinda wholesome actually! most of the teachers are really friendly and approachable (went back recently and had chats with teachers that remembered names of students from 4++ years ago). the non-teaching staff are also quite nice, they'll smile and say hi to you sometimes. I rmbr going to school at 630 during As period and this cleaning uncle wld always say good morning and it honestly gave me the motivation to study in the morning LOL. the guard at the side gate is also quite chill, he'll nod at you when you walk in/ out and say hi. 

another amazing part of nj would be the canteen. I still miss the caifan (altho they're closing soon :() because I've never found another one quite like it outside. ask anyone and they'll probably tell you that nj food is actl really good (god tier to me tbh). we have yong tau foo with the best soup (esp on cold days) and so many food that's made to order so it's hot when you get it (waffles, prata, xingzhou fried rice, laksa etc). the aunties and uncles are also just the best people because they'll say hi, ask if your exams were OK if it's exam period, encourage you to study hard... even after a few years, they still rmbr your face and will say hi and ask about uni life if you go back! 

the env in nj is also not very competitive and tbh everyone was really chill. mugger culture is quite common in all JCs since everyone's studying for As, so NJ is just the same as the rest of the JC population. 

circling back to the bad parts of nj, aka PW and old facilities... yeah I can't really vouch for them from my time because PW was a bad experience for me. but I heard that certain changes have been made to the department, plus the HOD changed so it's definitely going to be different. also, since PW grading has changed in general, you can probably expect the stress to decrease.

for old facilities, ngl NJ IS old because we were the first gov jc in sg. but that doesn't mean our things are breaking down everyday lah many things have been upgraded :) not gonna be as new as EJ or have aircon in every classroom, but it's a nice environment that's open and has tons of benches for you to study or hang out. I especially love the garden in the centre because it's so green (our teachers have worked really hard for it too!!! they keep introducing new initiatives like bee houses or planting new flowers and it's so pretty and educational). plus, many of the walls in nj are decorated, whether it is a new mural or a display of students' artworks. recently saw a classroom with a whale painted on its door?? and also another with hanging plants. 

honestly I can talk so much more about nj's good points but I shall stop here bc it's quite a long comment alr. you can ask specific qns/ dm me for more info!"
Regular_Mention_3919,29,Nj has nice teachers. Every school has nice teachers. It depends on how lucky you are to some extent. I was the one who trashed nj in the prev post but im still thankful for how much effort my math teacher put into teaching us.

blurikocaine,19,"not the most intuitive but yijc, the teachers really care about the students well-being.

for instance, my CTs. i had family problems and all of them really cared about me by offering a listening ear and support too.

also, the teachers are very open and eager into giving consults (teachers who dont teach you are also willing to give u consult)"
Dotty516,9,"Hello, current j1 at NJ here. Maybe I'm still to fresh to offer a complete perspective but as of now, the culture is fine. People here are chill and quite quiet, much less toxic(meanwhile my friends in ny are getting clowned on for asking questions in class). There aren't so many of those extroverted and outgoing ppl I will admit but the plus side is you get less petty drama and all that stuff. Maybe I got lucky but my teachers are very caring and will definitely support us the best they can when needed.

Personally, I believe especially for any social environment, it is mostly up to you. The truth is you are the person who determines who you wanna make friends with. Sure you will find bad apples but that is reality you need manage them as well as you can. Although school culture is quite important, I believe that you can find good supportive friends by reaching out to enough people. Teacher wise that one is out of your hands so gl"
Narrow-Examination-3,48,"From my experience EJC legit 👍🏻👍🏻👍🏻, legit play hard work hard culture and I think we have this extremely strong dancing culture that can’t be found elsewhere. E.g during grad day basically the whole cohort went to the middle of the school and blasted the songs of the 5 houses and started dancing it was damn cool 😎 

Teachers wise majority are really nice and willing to do 1-1 consultations and answer via WhatsApp! Think this one is vvv impt cuz during J2 I found myself needing a lot of teacher’s help on queries I had while studying.

The student environment wasn't good either, lots of toxic gossiping, and fighting for popularity (not a good way), arguing with others to be in a relationship etc. All these from what ive witnessed across classes and my class, that's why most didn't do well for A levels...........

That aside, there were  2 really good teachers ive met who were really helpful, 1 transferred to another school, another one I'm not sure. The principal back then was really nice and kind. Not sure how is jpjc like now, hopefully those bad teachers didn't move to jpjc."
studycookie,5,maybe not toxic but cj got terrible sci dept. didn’t affect me cuz i was in arts stream
ytolololol,3,"Was from ijc and then yijc. Like 1 guy said, theres no clear cut answer. The sch environment can be gr8 but if ur batch just rabak asf then culture aint saving it tbvh. Like what another guy said, for yijc, as long as u dont give up on urself in general the tutors still will kinda help out and give a shit generally. The ones who didnt/ toxic/ dogshit afaik has alr left the school mostly. The sch env is actually p ok, the canteen especially western stall is freakin awesome, llib is so so ok la , etc. Its honestly 100% depend on which batch u belong to and who the people u end up meeting that makes or breaks the experience. My time in IJC (final batch) was freakin toxic. It was so bad compared to the seniors, its just str8 up memeable. ""Mum, can we have nyjc?"" ""Honey, we have nyjc at home"" ""nyjc at home: *burning down in flames*"" (ijc from what i rmb was jokingly dubbed as the cmi nyjc so....)

On the contrary yijc was just str8 up wholesome. Sure got the jialat smol few cliques thats a shitstorm and a few ""bro this no go"" kinda incidents but it was nowhere near as bad as ijc on the contrary. Considering yijc first batch was run by ijc and yjc teachers/ culture carried over, it kinda made me realise ya its really the batch that goes in that makes or breaks it. Oh and would like to add this, open house might not 100% be a good indicator of culture since well they only show the good parts like duuh. For those who want go jc, i recommend going in with an open mind, and dont expect anyth. Just work ur ass off accordingly. More often; the higher your expectations, the harder it hits home when you get disappointed."
Omnipotent_chicken,2,"Many different responses but let me make this easy for you. There is no ‘correct’ answer… it depends on your luck really. Your classmates, teachers, subject combi, even your personality. Personally I was from SA and felt like I had a pretty shit experience though a lot will probably disagree. Ultimately schools are just a collective of students and teachers, and the hand you get isn’t something you can really decide. If anything, the biggest factors should be the environment (aka the campus), and how big events like orientation and CNY are held, but that’s a different qn entirely. Go for the open houses, see where your friends are going, and go with your gut feeling. It’s only 2 years anyways, JCs within the same academic tier aren’t that much diff. Don’t need think so much. Study hard and gl for JC!"

as an arts stream/hybrid student, if you want the possibility to still do a stem degree/career, h2 math and/or science will likely be needed. :) in this case then, you need to find a jc that is more flexible and/or has more options for subject combinations. from my experience in hwa chong, it was very flexible but i also understand not all jcs are this flexible due to constraints.

and if you do choose arts but want the freedom to explore some specific STEM majors in the future (like computer sci, buisness analytics), you may need to take on a 4H2 combination as H2 Math, unless you can take one of your arts subjects as an h1 (not impossible iirc, but again, find jcs with more flexible combinations! )"

With your RP, you should be able to enter NTU Double Major in Math and Econs (Link below). In the math major of the double major, you will be able to learn coding and algorithms in a mathematical rigorous way which will help in compensating for the lack of these skills with just a single major in econs.

[https://www.ntu.edu.sg/spms/about-us/mathematics/undergrad/degree-programmes/maeo-2021](https://www.ntu.edu.sg/spms/about-us/mathematics/undergrad/degree-programmes/maeo-2021) 

This double major will open up your career prospects to access careers available to both math major graduates and econs major graduates. It will also help you in tackling the more math leaning econs modules like econometrics. Anyway, if you want to do an econs major, to do well u can't run away from math too. As u would have heard, uni econs is very math. So as well get another major in math to complement your study of econs.

Quoted from my post (link above) last year, an example of how math can econs be in uni:

<<<

**Mathematics in Economics: Optimal Exchange-Rate Policy** *(Math and Economics)*  
  
How math can uni econs be? Well, take a look at the following paper by Prof Jamus Jerome Lim. Quoting from its abstract: ""This paper discusses how special interests and government policymakers interact in the decision-making processes concerning the optimal level of the exchange rate, and how these interactions may lead to a disconnect between the exchange rate and economic fundamentals.""  
  
[https://www.econstor.eu/bitstream/10419/64042/1/639581722.pdf](https://www.econstor.eu/bitstream/10419/64042/1/639581722.pdf)   
  
In the paper, he uses game theory concepts like ""subgame perfect Nash equilibrium"", which is a concept taught in the NTU math module: MH4320 Computational Economics. His paper proves various lemma/corollary/propositions using mathematical proof techniques. His propositions 3 and 4 prove the formulae for the exchange rate with legislative activity and electoral dynamics respectively.  
  
If you are looking into doing the more math aspects of economics and/or perhaps writing your own theorems about economics like in the above paper, then NTU Double major in math and econs will be a good preparation to do that. The math degree will give you the strong training to do math proofs and can be applied to the economics concepts you learn in the econs major.

In the same post, I have also mentioned how math and economics theory like game theory helps to tackle covid 19 issue:

<<<

**COVID-19 Contact Tracing Apps: (Economics) Game Theory and Graph/Network Theory** *(Applied Math / Statistics / Economics / Compsci / Data Analytics)*  
  
Hear from the Carnegie Mellon Math Professor, a 3 minutes introduction to ""NOVID: A New Approach to Beat COVID-19"":  
  
[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EIU-6FvwikQ&t=0s](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EIU-6FvwikQ&t=0s)   
  
Quoting from another youtube video (link below) on what makes this app NOVID so special:  
  
""The simple idea flips the incentives. Previous approaches were about controlling you, preemptively removing you from society if you were suspected of being infected. This new tool lets you see incoming disease to defend yourself just in time. This uniquely aligns incentives so that even if everyone in a democratic society does what is best for themselves, they end up doing what is best for the whole.""  
  
The following 40 minutes video is a talk by this math professor showing how (Economics) Game Theory and Graph/Network Theory is used in developing NOVID.  
  
[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Au08hbFyDY](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Au08hbFyDY)   
  
As SG pushes smart nation and enhances our defense capabilities against threats including natural diseases, the applications in math in such areas (e.g. developing a better contact tracing app for public health) are of great importance. There are many interesting projects done by A\*STAR, DSTA, DSO, and other organisations that involve advanced math. Every year, there are math degree undergrads from both NTU/NUS who went to these organisations to do internships and full-time employment. And math degree graduates are favoured for their ability to take on projects that involve lots of advanced math.

>dbl major in bis so that itll open up more prospects due to soft skills

I think many people think that a key advantage of going to business school is can improve their soft skills. I feel this is really quite a poor reason to go to business school. It sounds as if non-business degrees' curriculum don't develop much soft skills. The fact is that soft skills can be learned in any degree. Any degree also has presentations, group work, and some level of class participation (may or may not be graded). Is just that a business degree focus on selling ideas to businesses so has more business-style presentations. And usually, the content in business is less technical, so they have fewer written tests and exams, while having more presentations and group work. Another thing is, as one does uni internships, one will need to hone soft skills like presentations, and group work skills also. Thus, don't need to worry about not having enough soft skills if don't do a business major."

Historical_Bus_1889,5,"Hi! I take P.Geog, I have been consistently  doing quite well for geog so here are some of my tips:
1. WATCH BERNICE LOON SHE IS A LIFE SAVER🙏🙏🙏 I’m s4 this year and in s3 i had a teacher that wasn’t very good so i relied a lot on youtube (Bernice Loon) to help me out! It was really helpful, she gives such concise notes and mind maps (but content like examples you would have to rely on urself)
2. PRACTICE PRACTICE PRACTICE! Do PYPs and ask your teacher to mark! I did this in s3 and did well! Especially for LORMS question, doing a single LORMS question (without textbook) can help you recall everything in a gateway!
3. Honestly geography is super content heavy subject, during EOYs i definitely did not finish all of the content that i had to memorise…so be prepared to carve out a lot of time weeks before the exam to memorise content 
4. As for GI, i don’t really have any tips to score for this except memorise sampling methods, source of error, and methods to investigate whatever thing.
5. SGExam’s library of notes for PGeog and EGeog is a life saver. Use the resources given!
6. LISTEN and focus in class, geography has a lot of content but you’ll never be able to memorise without understanding it. The understanding part comes in class. (But looking at ur situation, i think it’s best if u give feedback or self-study a lot)
That’s it! Hope you this helps!"
Waru0_0,4,"I can't really help you but I can provide some hope for you. For me, I was barely scraping through my Geography WAs, MYE, failed my Prelims but still got A2 in O levels when l took it last year. The only ""tuition"" l had was a crash course in the June holidays at Indigo Education Centre. The notes have a good format but the wording is basically the same as textbook.
 I recommend you use some acronyms to help remember different factors and add some visuals if you plan to make notes or try to relate a certain factor with a photo. I think that makes it easier to recall. I know it's kinda old school but u shld start cramming the chapters you learnt in sec3 and do the tys immediately. But, do not follow the ans for elective geog tys solution booklet, may not be very accurate.
All in all, don't be disheartened by bad results. It just takes a significant amount of time to memorize and develop your answering techniques.🙂"

Eurito1,2,Is it 100% confirm that you are dropping? Cos you can get tuition of pure chem and physics. It's good foundation for poly or jc science/engineering courses.
akaisy,1,"hey op! i’m here to answer your last point. as someone who has taken pure physics and chemistry for one year and dropped to combined the next year, i can definitely say that the content WAY more manageable and the way the questions are structured is more straightforward. 

so for a little background information, i’ve always DREADED pure chemistry and it was mostly because of my teacher’s teaching style. she always made me abit frightened to ask questions in class and her teaching pace is way too fast. i barely scraped by mostly with d7’s and rare passes. despite studying my very hardest for pure chemistry, it always didn’t bear fruit. pure physics was quite literally the opposite though. i’ve scored b4’s on average and i enjoyed the subject a lot.

i never regretted dropping to combined because i’ve eventually learned to love chemistry. in fact, i ended up enjoying studying for chem more than physics! i would say that the content jump for chemistry is quite big however for physics i really couldnt tell the difference HAHA. 

i went from a d7 in pure chemistry to an a1 for combined phy/chem and i’m glad to say that i made the right choice."

Generally wait till you’re past puberty, and give it an extra year or two or more just to be sure.

Heart break is no joking matter, people commit suicide over this sort of thing, not to mention murder and other seriously damaging behaviour (substance abuse, sexual assault, public humiliation like release sex tape or nudes) 

If even adult relationships end up in divorce and adultery and all sorts of trouble, what more about relationships for the younger ones?

Hackzx_,3,">workload/stress, competitiveness

Workload, stress and competitiveness differs depending on individual. If someone who is weak in math enters BZA then he/she will feel stressed for sure. Same thing for BBA w BA spec, if you put someone who hates presentations then he/she will definitely be stressed for sure.

Curriculum wise, BZA will be more math heavy than BBA w BA spec. But prospect wise, it depends more on what you choose to develop outside of school (e.g internships). I have seen peers who are in BBA w BA spec move into data scientist roles as well. Generally, for tech roles, you will be assessed in technical assessments for the job rather than being hired solely based on the name of your degree.

Alone_Abrocoma_9666,3,"1. there’s usually 2 types of subj combi - double sci or triple sci so a typical double sci combi would be: eng, mt, math, a math, chem, 2nd sci, pure humanities, ss/humanities (ss/humanities is ss + maybe like half of pure humanities) and a typical triple sci combi would be: eng, mt, math, a math, chem, bio, phy, ss/humanities

2. depends on your sch actually! i listed the typical one above but it ranges frm 6 (if you dh a math or your sch doesn’t offer a pure humanities for the double sci combi) to 10 (if you have third lang or like hmt then you’ll be taking mt o levels in sec 3 and hmt o levels in sec 4)

3. pure sci is like 100% syllabus but combined sci is like 70ish% of each but it’s considered one subject like chem/bio or chem/phy (i say 70ish and not 50ish bcus you do learn more than half of pure lah just that the qns may be easier also)

also your jc subj combi sometimes do affects the subj you can take in jc (esp for sci but humanities not really) usually it’s like brought up uk like if you took o level phy then can take h2 phy so just do some research abt that if you’re concerned"
itxjaeda,2,"1) regarding how to choose subj combi for math n sci. Firstly, imo u shld rlly like ask urself if u hv considered gg to jc or are u considering more of poly. Since I’m in JC now to share my experience w this subj combi thing so that hopefully u can understand better is that for most kids gg to jc, most ppl will take up Amath and pure sci or maybe even triple sci if u do well during ur EOY ltr this yr. This is especially so if ur aiming to go sci stream in JC and I can only say pure sci n amath is rlly v important. So for myself I screwed up in sec two n took combined sci n poa so for me I’m still in JC sci stream but I obv struggle more than my peers as of now since I’m still in year 1. So my advice is def do take pure sci n amath if u can!! But if u can’t n ur like me… I’m still taking double H2 science (H2 chem n H2 bio) cuz I managed to score A1 in combined sci at o lvls which is the requirement to take double H2 sci in jc for most schs (if I’m not wrong) but for math I have to take H1 sadly :( cuz to take H2 most schs req u to have done amath at o lvls n score ard a B3 or better at least for my JC. If u didn’t take… u can sit for a readiness test on amath n if u pass then u can req go take H2 math. Ok so… if ur aiming to go poly if I’m not wrong pure sci n amath isn’t so important but if u do take n u wanna get into like courses in poly that r engineering or sci related then gfy I think u will be more prepared n ready in some way so it’s more like for ur own benefit.

2) to go to JC u need 6 subj n poly if I’m not wrong it’s 5? Ofc most ppl including myself take ard 7 n some ppl go rlly extreme n take 8-9 so yea. But imo 7 is more than enough cuz at least u have more time to focus on revision for each subj during o lvls so yea

3) ok for my sch it was a gone case. I’ve always been good at humanities but my sec sch didn’t offer pure humanities so I took combined or also known as elective so none of the students in my cohort took pure n I’m not in jc arts stream so idk if pure is important for humanities. But frm what I heard it rlly isn’t so important as most art stream subjects have no pre requisite for example I’m now taking H2 econs without even having knowledge of econs at o lvl. Furthermore, I was even offered H2 geog when I took combined history n ss at o lvl. So what I’m saying is art subj don’t rlly have strict pre requisite as compared to sci subjects like H2 math n H2 sciences. Then like I mentioned for sci alr how to choose between combined n pure is rlly if u wanna go JC pure gives u an upper hand esp if u wanna go sci stream. Cuz for me I’m rlly dying in jc rn n most of my classmates took pure n they seem like they r better able to cope so yea. Rlly advice u take pure if u do wanna go jc sci stream but if not taking combine is def ok also. Like I will say both got pros n cons. So many of my pure sci friends couldn’t score A1 at o lvls so their L1R5 isn’t as good but on the other side my L1R5 is better but I lack the knowledge that they have at o lvl for sciences so yea

Let’s say u start dating him and have arguments, he might frequently mention ‘it’s cos I’m frm ITE right’ as an excuse to win the fight. I feel like he has a huge victim mentality after that ‘I’m frm ITE’ statement. These kind of guys won’t accept no for an answer. It’s not about the fking education level. It’s about CHARACTER. I also used to date my first ex who was frm poly during my ITE days. If things don’t work out, they don’t work out.

I do agree on another commenter regarding the education and pay grade however this will not be a vaild point if he choose upgrade himself. I was also an ITE student before and I upgraded myself to a diploma. My pay wise now can be comparable with a fresh grad if not slightly more.

ForwardBed4817,11,"Okay, on side note, just want to highlight… initially you said you wanted to consider him after your studies, graduation.

However, later on you wavered and said that you kinda like him too? So do you truly like him or are you giving in because you lack confidence in yourself? I know I sound like an asshole but it’s really important you make the decision yourself and not let his messages affect you.

Another thing to highlight, the guy seemed pretty suspicious for confessing after 2 years of online conversation. To be honest, he hasn’t seen your whole face. Again, I know i sound like an asshole. 

But perhaps you might want to consider braving it and share a full face of yourself before going forward. At least the rejection would be less hurtful, you know before you confessing that you have feelings too.

Also, nobody makes sound decision in the middle of the night at 3am. Have a good sleep and come to a decision the day after. Never rush to make hasty decisions."

Also being nice online doesn't mean he's a nice person  irl.you wouldn't know until u actually have spent alot of time with a person whether they are nice or not be it a friend or bf or whatever."
FishyJian,6,"A lot of others have already mentioned it but I’ll just say it again. It is not rude to reject someone, it is not rude to not be ready for a romantic relationship. His victim complex is really strong with this and that message that he sent shows he is at the very least not very emotionally stable or mature. Being in a relationship where you have to carry all the emotional baggage is gonna be exhausting to say the least. 

I understand that you do not want to hurt him because you treasure him as a friend, but you have to remember, he is only just that. If he can’t take no for an answer now and sent an almost harassing text in the middle of the night, what will it be next time. He wants to have sex and you don’t? he’ll send you another one in the middle of the night, going all about him being in ite, you’re in ri and then you’ll cave too? I know what you’ll say, “when it comes time for something so serious, I won’t do it.” But I can reassure you, you cross your own boundaries now, you’ll do it again and you’ll keep doing it until one day, you won’t even realize you’ve got no boundaries left. 

Also, if he really wanted to, and if he really wants to be with you but without the gap between your educations, he’ll study real hard to get to where you are, or he’ll make sure to do something that’ll allow him to fit you, in his own mind. This is really a case of, if he wanted to, he would. 

I wish you all the best OP and although I have a strong feeling that you’ll go ahead with the relationship to not be rude, I would only highly suggest that you have a really good support system, be it your mom, friends, siblings, cousins or even trusted teachers. “當局者迷，旁观者清” they’ll help you see what you can’t see."
Capable_Link_5246,11,"I would suggest focusing on doing well for your A-Levels first, before getting into any relationship. You will definitely have to cope with a high workload the next 2 years and committing to a relationship might lead to more problems, so don’t feel pressured to start dating him unless you genuinely feel like he’s the right one for you. I’m judging all of this at surface level so you should probably take my words of advice with a pinch of salt, but he definitely could  have been more understanding when you rejected him, instead of typing out a whole message calling you elitist when that clearly isn’t the case. The fact that he was texting you hurtful words in the middle of the night also sort of shows that he can’t control his emotions, just like how people sometimes say that “A drunk mind speaks a sober person’s thoughts.” (I might be wrong though, because you are the one who knows him best and should be able to make a decision based on what is best for you.) I would still suggest have a conversation with him about it so that the both of you would be able to gain a better understanding of each other’s views though. Do remember that you should never feel obligated to rush into a relationship, because you should be first asking yourself whether you are currently even ready to commit to dating someone in the first place. I hope that you will be able to sort this out soon and all the best for JC !"
GloxyVI,33,"I am gonna be that Gandalf sitting on a chair and level with you.

RI and ITE is likely a bad mix.

 Not because he is a bad guy, in fact he may be the best and most kindest soul on earth, but when you grow up past University like your seniors, you will be worried about one thing and one thing only. Money.

I am gonna list 2 scenarios for you. Two couples:

\-Assuming full 20% downpayment no issue

\-Assuming 3.7% interest rate

Couple A: Duo income of $8,000 (both 4k)

Max Loan: $506k

Couple B: Duo income of $6,600 ($4k & ITE's $2.2k median)

Max Loan: $392k

So already when you both will wanna BTO, you either have to settle for smaller options and/or less well to do locations.

Don't forget you still have your wedding (if you want one) that is approximately $30-50k since all the wedding venues in SG has jacked up the prices to $200 per person for a low-end hotel.

I won't go on, you get the gist. Singapore is immensely costly to live in if you wanna have a decent life. At your current age you don't have to pay bills yet and so you don't feel the pinch. Once you have to start worrying about inflation, money, wedding, downpayments, if your other partner can't contribute equal weight, then it might strain your relationship very much.

Money is the one thing that causes relationships to collapse. I assume since you are from RI (based on probability) you would want to travel overseas, visit Europe, Switzerland, New Zealand etc and all of the relatively costly countries in your life. All of this + children + house + car will be heavily straining on your finances.

Your seniors in NUS/NTU/SMU are already feeling it, hence you see so many making career switches into Tech or picking up code. Not because they enjoy it, but mostly due to survival instincts kicking in as they approach graduation and to get better offers.

\-

Not discouraging you from being with him, but if you do, it'd be best you do it with eyes open and aware of the consequences of the decision. If you are willing to forgo overseas trips, condos, cars, and stay in a 4 room in non-mature. Then it's alright. 

Just two cents."

My bro life went on cus he took his degree at nus and started work. Obv my parents didnt like it  cus who would date an ite girl, She most likely smokes(im sorry) shes not the same race too... so like now shes earning more than my bro haha and my parents and their parents are okay with it.

Maybe you are young and suddenly he is holding back which makes you want him more. Think twice. Don’t rush into things. If he really love you, he won’t just stop loving you after few mins. Then that’s not real. You have a good future and it is more important. If he loves you, he will want the best of you. Not hoping you will fail and go ITE with him. Then this kind of boyfriend is not a good one. You need someone who can give you support and want you to be happy. And not want you be miserable because he is also miserable. This kinda of person is toxic. 

After you graduate years later, he is already an uncle. Looks will fade. Must be careful too. Older man sometimes find younger girls easy to cheat. Your job and future worth more than dating. People, thing and mindset will change overtime. You never know if it will lasts. Don’t think it worth.

biskwy,1,"Honestly, it's kind of immature for him to blame you for simply not being interested in him. But not everyone handles rejection well, especially when you're younger. That being said, this notion of elitism and his insecurities will be a thorn in your friendship. 

He's insecure about his career/education. Meanwhile you're insecure about your looks/attractiveness. 

You know a classic phrase for dilemmas is ""go with the first choice because that's what you genuinely feel is best"". Of course this isn't applicable to all situations but I think you're right. 

Graduate first and get some life experience. Rarely good comes out of two deeply insecure teenagers who have no idea how to navigate through their emotional issues.

Early_Personality_68,1,"First of all you probably want to tackle this head on.

Tell him you saw the message he sent, and it’s not because of that, basically let him know you only saw him as a friend.

I don’t think it’s a red flag, personally. You’re both young, and guys at that age don’t really handle their emotions as well as most would hope. Let him grow into his skin a bit more before judging.

I want you to bring this up into the open firstly to see how he handles it, is he aggressive with you, is he understanding and apologetic? If the latter, consider going out with him.

Secondly, girl, if you kinda liked him, why push him away? These things don’t “just happen”. He picked up on the vibe you were giving off subconsciously and thought he had a shot. Men nowadays don’t just confess to whomever is in their radius, not the good ones at least.

He must have confided in some of his bros and they must have told him you were out of his reach because of that RI thing.

Lastly, be honest, does it really not matter? At some level, we all know it does. Your parents will probably not approve. How are you guys financially? Remember if he is in ITE now he still has two years of national service before he can start bring bread home, is he going to start his degree studies, or no?

The fact of the matter is you will probably be earning far more than him in the short term, in some cases, long term, is that okay with you? Can you respect someone like that as a partner?

I hope you find your own answers, good luck."

scorchyflakes,52,"Honestly, as a member of the queer community (bi), I say don’t go to the meeting. From what you’ve said, it sounds like they’d just gaslight/guilt trip you the entire time if you went.

>in the first week, I struggled calling them by the name they wanted to be called by and using their pronouns because I was too used to addressing them by she/her and their birth name.

If they were really your friend, they would’ve heard out your side of the story. It seems they don’t know what habits are.

You called them by their birth name and she/her pronouns out of habit, yes, but you genuinely didn’t mean any harm, did you? I don’t see why they couldn’t have understood that. Unless, of course, you didn’t communicate your thoughts about it to them.

But regardless, it was too harsh of them to jump to conclusions and call you transphobic.

>when I asked my trans friends about this meme, they told me that their opinion doesn’t matter because the meme was never catered to the trans community anyway.

The fact that this meme wasn’t for the trans community in any way (as proven when you spoke to your trans friends), yet your ex-friend got offended and again, accused you of transphobia, is just ridiculous.

Perhaps your ex-friend had a valid reason for being offended, but you mentioned that they didn’t even give a proper explanation as to why they got offended, so it honestly seems kind of dubious lmao.

Though, as a reminder, you should not prioritise likes over a friendship, in the future.

>I told them beforehand to not wear anything revealing out of respect for my culture and religon.

I find it baffling that they got mad. Seeing as how you know your ex-friend likes wearing stockings with short miniskirts and tight tank tops, they have probably worn that a lot around you and other friends.

So, you asking them to not wear that for just one occasion to respect your own culture and religon (with years and years of history and tradition btw), is reasonable. It’s not like you shame them for their choice of clothing (seeing as they probably wear it on the regular), yeah?

Yeah, yeah, I know. “Their body, their choice. Why should they have to stop wearing something they like just because of this?” No one said they had to stop wearing miniskirts and tank tops completely. It’s literally just to respect someone’s culture for the short amount of time they’re visiting your house. What’s so difficult about that?

>my mom was born in another generation and if I tell her that this friend goes by another name, she will keep questioning me and then it will turn into an argument.

Idk why your ex-friend lashed out and called you transphobic for a problem that lies with something else lmao (something else being your mother’s mindset).

>this friend decided to break off this friendship by telling me hurtful things like how I’m a pick me, transphobic and lgbtq try hard

Not sure where the ‘pick-me’ part came out of. They probably learnt that word off Twitter/TikTok and used it during your confrontation to make themselves seem like they’re completely in the right (without even knowing what it means). I genuinely see no part of this entire story where you have been a ‘pick-me’.

‘LGBTQ try-hard’💀💀The heck does that even mean? Ironic how your ex-friend is a member of the queer community yet doesn’t seem to know that people who have unlabeled sexualities are considered LGBTQ lol. Being unlabeled doesn’t equate to being straight.

‘Transphobic’. It seems they’re convinced you’re transphobic so slay ig.

Honestly? With all the information that has been provided, I don’t think either party is completely innocent. But it seems as though your ex-friend just shifted all of the blame onto you only.

So yeah, this is my thought process and why I think you shouldn’t attend it.

To other redditors, feel free to fight me on any of my views on this matter btw, I won’t stop you :)

FlameGreyWolf,11,"Your ""friend"" sounds like my bff's ex with the messages and tones and all. 

Being trans/bixesual/queer doesn't automatically give them a pass to not be a decent human. You were the one to reach out, and yes I understand habits will be habits but you already change the way you called them and while it took some time to adjust you don't just go slipping back into that. 

The problem here is that they are not willing to allow you time to change and think change is overnight. That makes you an abuser in their book since you didn't change when asked to (Because of habits). 
Honestly do you even want this person as a friend? I feel it's very emotionally draining to be around someone who keeps digging up the past that is so dear to them that severs the ties of friendship y'all had for years.

For you to adjust to their pronouns and new name in a week is amazing! Great job on that! Them to call you transphobic for not instantly adjusting is😟😟😟😟 to me, they dont seem very understanding of other's situations except for their own. To insist youre straight when youre unlabelled is also highly disrespectful.

I started to realise that some people are just walking red flags. Some people never grow up, think the world revolves around them, and constantly victimizes themselves.

I've noticed that Singaporean transpeople in general are very much a circle-jerk when it comes to perceived ""transphobia"" and discrimination, and they absolutely take every opportunity to make it all about how persecuted they are.

You can't change other people's perceptions on trans and queers ( your mom) and this is not your responsibility. Respect the older generation for having their own opinions just like you respect the queers for having theirs.

sunshinebygab,3,"I must say, this was difficult for me to read because well, I had a friend who shared many many similarities with the person you're talking about in the post. Sexuality and gender identity aside of course. She's similar in the sense that whenever things didn't go her way, exactly in the direction that she wanted, she'd pull out the good ol' threatening card. Either by insulting me, questioning my morals of taking a few hours to reply when I was busy and overall being an ass. 

I don't think your friend over here has any justification flinging those terms around, over the most trivial of shit. Transphobia by its very definition, no matter how loose, implies that you either have a fear (phobia) towards those whose gender identity doesn't align with the one they were assigned to at birth, or you have certain harmful biases and prejudices you refuse to change. You look down on them, you refuse to accept them or respect their identity, you express hatred or thinly veiled contempt.  Transphobia. Homophobia. Bigotry. Misogyny etc. 

I'm sure there are others who have summed this up in a much more succinct way but my point still stands. You have demonstrated none of that. You've made a very conscious effort into learning their new name by heart and correcting what's basically muscle memory built up for a very long time. It isn't easy and yet you did your best because you respected their identity and personhood and your friendship with them. That's one of the biggest show of support you could ever offer. I'd kill to have friends like you who'd just accept me. Questions asked or not, I'd still be a person to them and not a theory whose very person hood's up for debate. I see zero insensitivity or transphobia in your actions here and it's a pity they did not 1. acknowledge and 2. thank you for your efforts. It's a damn pity they decided to be so self centered and misinformed and cruel, accusing you of shit you did not do. It's a damn pity. 

The meme issue too ... It just all seems so one sided, this conflict. With them being the initiator of such pointless discord and you having to forgive and forget their frankly atrocious behaviour. What does their trans identity have to do with ... whatever that meme was even about? It contains nothing derogatory, nothing even remotely to do with the trans community or transness as a topic. It's just a meme? And they stirred up shit over that 🫠 I wonder if they've perhaps missed their home under the bridge surrounded by swamp animals cause this screams troll behaviour. However, you're the one that went through this shit and you have my sympathies man. 

As for the last part regarding your wishes for her to dress more appropriately considering your culture and religion present in your household when they're friggin visiting y o u r house, I find it all to be perfectly reasonable. And I find nothing problematic with you gently cautioning them that your mother will call them by their birth name and there's really not much to do about it. Old fashioned and from the older generation. It's also only natural you wish to avoid any further conflict considering you were sick. It's absolutely shocking behaviour from their end, to slap an accusation of transphobia and pickme and whatnot when you've been trying your best to accommodate them, and only wish that they'd respect your culture and your wishes in your home. Blatant disrespect from them and it's a shame. 

Just one simple request to dress down. With nothing revealing out of respect for your household and religion, and they fucking snap. Perhaps you should slap the label of islamphobia or christianphobia? on them. Add another one for intolerance of any identities besides their own and any views and sexualities outside of their narrow worldview. I don't know if there's a term for this kind of behaviour, shaming others for being unsure of their sexuality or preferring to remain unlabelled but it does scream close minded, tight fisted and they're nothing if not a giant git. Imagine if someone insisted they were the gender they're not. Oh yes, add hypocrite to the list. You don't know what or who you are and that's fine. You're valid just the way you are and it's a shame they're spouting the rhetoric of people who'd rather have them wiped from existence. Imagine enforcing your idea of another person's sexuality onto them 🫠 cringe indeed 

I'm really sorry you've encountered such a person in your life. And that you've had to put up with all this bullshit for such a long time. They're horribly misinformed, a massive bigot if I ever saw one and the closest minded person I've ever met who's at the same time, trans. You didn't deserve a word of their insults and it's a shame, a shame I say, that they never ever appreciated you for the friend that you were to them. They're missing out on a gem but that's fine cause they're shit anyway. Excuse the ... indelicate language. I genuinely think you should end it here. Really."

kay000000,2,"Everyone's saying to cut them off and i don't disagree completely but I'd say it's more important to consider how important this friend is. 

It seems like they were lashing out and taking their frustration out on you because SG in general is not very friendly to LGBTQ people and they were probably hoping you would be a safe space for them. It's natural to take a bit longer to get used to your friend changing their name/pronouns and it's a bit unfair of them to react in the way they did. 

But the act of changing your name/pronoun is more significant to them than to you. So of course something small to you like how you struggled with getting the right pronouns or how you asked them present as something they are not to your parents, will feel like a huge deal for them. 

If you feel like this friendship is not worth the frustration on your end then cutting things off is for the best for both of you. But now it seems like maybe your friend is in a position where they will actually be able to understand where you come from a little better, so if you still value their friendship then i don't think you will lose anything by taking some time to meet them. Most important is to listen to their perspective and empathise with their situation as best you can, then try and let them know your point of view.

If they're still dismissive of your pov and unwilling to try and meet you in the middle. Then cutting things off is not a bad thing.

Good luck! And I hope things go smoothly no matter what you decide."
MobiSqrd,2,"1. as a queer myself, you’re totally valid. when i thought i was straight and cis, it took some time to get used to calling my trans friend by his preferred pronouns, and my friend was totally fine with it. even for me, as long as it’s not on purpose, i really don’t care about how someone addresses me, bc i understand they might not be used to it.

2. honestly, that meme has nothing to do with any part of the lgbtqia+ community so you’re good"
Nekomonochan,2,"As someone who knows a lot of trans people and researches what causes someone to identify as trans on a psychological level, I believe that on a objective level, this person probably feels like the world around them will refuse the identity that they have chosen for themselves. The overcompensating nature seems to come from a place of hurt, and also rebellion. The gender dysphoria is pain enough, and when they see that the world around them seems to reflect their fears of not being accepted, they feel even more pain.

I really do empathize with this kind of situation. Although my personal opinion is that making innocent people pay for your internal suffering is a complete asshole move.

You don't have to feel guilty for the pain that others may feel, especially if you did not cause it and have no realistic solutions to their pain. Hope this helps?"

If it is.  Then have a clear conversation about where you think this needs to go.

2) My friends’ friend who is currently study in NYP motion graphic. She said need to pass ( but she do not have to retake so she may be unfamiliar about this?) 
Just like u I never find anything about need to retake part in their poly website. However in their website Q&A section I asked if need to retake o lvl. The website said that “ If you missed the minimum English grade required by one grade, but you have obtained good grades in your school's English Preliminary Exam, in Mathematics and a relevant subject during GCE 'O' Level Exams, you may still apply through our Direct Admissions Exercise (DAE). “  
Does  this minimum English grade means entry requirement or o lvl passing?"

Suspicious_Mode_9302,4,"hi, I joined SIM UOL Banking & Finance last year (now renamed to Finance). SIM has career fairs that invites company’s to come down to speak with the student and to look for internships or FT jobs for graduating students. I would have to agree that the starting pay is not as fancy as you see on the new articles. To get a good salary, you really need to work hard on your portfolio and your results. Heard that a class difference in your degree would have a difference $600 starting salary which can be a lot. 

Career prospects wise, finance degree is pretty big so there are many sectors you can actually look into. A finance degree doesn’t necessarily mean you have to do investment banking. Finance degree has a POA module that we have to take in Year 1 as well. So rlly depends on what is your interest. 

Reputation might not be comparable to the local big unis but it is still recognised in the private sector. All in all, I would say a private degree might take you longer to achieve what you want but it’s is still possible to be successful just that it takes time :)"
Dramatic_Rest7487,4,"Any/most tom dick harry can get into kaplan/murdoch... get the hint ?

Unless you are not particular about which companies you join/send your resume to next time... lets face it, when HR starts processing applications 1 of the first thing they look besides your education level (whether u match the requirement) is your alma mater. Hard truth"
bloom4eva,2,"great insights from u/Suspicious_Mode_9302 ! (also TIL they change banking & finance to finance haha)

I need to clarify that UOL ≠ LSE. Yes, LSE provide academic direction to UOL, we share resources with LSE and can get credit exemptions if we went for LSE summer exchange program. I think to put it simply, LSE provide their syllabus, UOL just filter it down to be of less rigour curriculum than LSE. All exams is written & marked by UOL. So at the end of the day, your certificate states 'University of London'. But honestly, UOL does have more 'reputation' than say kaplan.

Anyways moving on, i have friends in kaplan and they told me people in kaplan are mostly there for their fast-tracked degree. So this also means theres not much school culture, i remember them telling me they don't have much school support as well. I am not saying SIM is better, but we do have a decent career guidance team, school clubs & student councils & an okay-to-decent school culture. There are plenty of SIM-UOL that do well and land in bb/ib/big 4s, some directly after graduation others maybe after working for 1 year. 

but i'm not saying we have it easy, and not saying that being in SIM-UOL guarantees you to land in these fancy branded name firms. these alumnis work really hard and scored first class/upper second class, many of them did crap loads of internship during their time in school which brings me to my next point. the good thing about SIM-UOL is that we have a 3 1/2 month term break, that is sufficient time for you to go for summer internships.

so my advice for you is honestly, just pick SIM-UOL. but if you want to quickly finish school and work immediately, then kaplan is an alternative choice."
Eurito1,2,"Computational Thinking and Design and Data Driven World can also be considered core CS. You can also use your electives to specialise in something CS related. 

No matter how many modules the school teaches you, you still have to do a lot of self learning. So there's really not much difference. And SUTD's curriculum is already very tough, hence the phrase stay up till dawn. 

At the end of the day, internships, networking, self learning, etc. are more important."

everraydy,2,">AMD Ryzen 7 5800X

At this point, I'm damn sure that the person who writes these specs at TP doesn't really know what he/she's doing. The 5800X is a 105W class Desktop CPU that can draw up to 142W of power. Plus the 8550U is much much slower than the 5800U (which I believe is the what they wanted to write initially)

Of the 3 you have listed, the Vivobook K6500 is the most powerful, with a discrete GPU that will be useful for video editing. If you don't need the extra graphical horsepower, I would advise against it, cuz those laptops tend to be heavier..

idk if the activities are still the same but i did do high-element activities. there's zipline but what i did was to like ""climb a ladder"" and the thing i had to climb on was made of wood and it's shakey so yeah, was pretty tough but fun!!

+ if ur vv sensitive to cold pls bring a LIGHT jacket/windbreaker or at least long sleeve to wear at night bcos early in the morning when u wake up IT WOULD BE SO COLD like even I don't get cold very easily and I was shivering as soon as I woke up like full on teeth chattering shivering after a while when u move about it gets better but if ur rly sensitive just bring 

+ not packing but pls look out for wild monkeys AND ESPECIALLY WILD BOARS on one night a boar bit through our tarp covering the bags and completely shredded my watchmates food pack at the top of her bag(it ate through the camping bag as well)

As for the food, they will give you 5 days worth of food, just plan for 4 days, for me on the 4th day evening they gave additional ingredients for us to cook our food(not instant noodles), as well as providing a knife and cutting board.

Take care of ur stuff and remember where u left them (i lost my shoes)

A watch if u have one (can bring small alarm clock if u can, very helpful when u wake up in the morning) 

Wet wipes or tissue paper very helpful but not very necessary

You can bring a fan like what other people said but based on my experience all the nights were pretty cold, but that was maybe because my tent has only 3 people"

Sarvinjeet,47,"YIJC J2 here!

1. Really depressed atmosphere. 90% of the students here either want to leave as soon as possible or want to burn the school down. It’s very uncommon to see someone that actually likes this college. Everyone is always shitting on the school, teachers, principal and, of course, their O Level grades. Students here hardly want to be associated with the college. I know a few friends that wear jackets whenever they leave the campus to go home cause they do not want the public to see them wearing the school uniform.

2. Food here is kinda mid. We have around 10(?) canteen stalls but only 5(?) are open. As a result, the queues are always very long and may take you around 15 mins of waiting time before u actually order your food. Food is definitely not worth the price. Very expensive for small portions and mid quality of food.

3. Science department is actually quite good but it depends on the teachers u get. In fact, our science department is well-known to be better than CJC’s and on par with TMJC’s. Math department is so-so (again it depends on your teachers). Not too sure about the arts department but I heard their notes are quite well-written and students from other JCs refer to our notes for its simplicity. Econs and PW departments are trash, which is evident from our distinction rates. The Econs and PW teachers seem confused themselves. 

4. Campus is extremely run-down. Paint peeling off the walls is not an uncommon sight. The level 1 classrooms are quite dark (especially the J block classrooms). One of our lecture theatres and auditorium are currently closed due to air con leakage. A few classrooms have also reported spoiled air cons and there was a case where a fan almost dropped from the ceiling (iirc). However, we will be shifting to the Innova campus (Woodlands) in 2 years time so hopefully the new campus is better.

5. Mugging culture exists but not common. You can definitely see many students studying after school and there are also quite a number of top scorers that score above 70/80 rp consistently in JC1. Unfortunately, there are also a high number of retainees as a lot students just give up the moment they enrol into the college. Our school is literally called ‘JPJC/TMJC/CJC rejects’. A fair number of O level single pointers, though.

6. Many exciting events to look out for throughout the two years. ‘Listen’ is an annual concert that is very popular and the public also came to our college to attend it. Two sports events a year, ‘KOTA’ and ‘KOTS’. Etc…

7. We have HBL every Thursday. The HBL is asynchronous for most subjects and is done on SLS. We also have F2F lectures in the LTs. Every class has a fixed home room. We have at least 1 break a day and it will be for at least an hour. Library closes at 4pm (iirc) everyday so that’s a bummer. 

8. Cool places outside of the college to hang out. Northpoint Mall is about 20 mins walk away. Our college is sandwiched right in the middle of 2 MRT stations so you can just go to either one. One problem is that YI is in Yishun so it’s not rare to hear or see peculiar things going on (LOL). 

9. I feel like what myths people have about YIJC is mostly true lmao, but this is just based on personal experience. 

These are just some thing I thought of. Feel free to ask me questions :)

Overall: 1 star out of 5 max. Not recommended."
1ampoc,40,"Edit: sry, meant to reply to OP's comment so read that first

J3 here. Back when I was there we didn't have any chinese songs, but then again it was covid so we didn't sing much.

How well bonded ur class was also dependent on which class u went to. Students in SMTP/GATE classes mostly just focus on mugging, including during break times, so interaction is limited. But then again, this was during covid, where tables were separate (exam style), and we had homerooms. And from what the school management said, this mugging culture seems to be a covid problem. 

I've been to some other schools and I've to agree HCI's architecture is not bad.

For the Econs dept, their notes and content are fine, very comprehensive and understandable. The teachers are knowledgeable and teach well too. But the problem (imo), is that they make the subject too much about regurgitation, which makes it not fun. And Econs is not just learn content and give correct answers, there needs to be some sort of analysis and evaluation which is original and insightful (based on context) to score top marks. The content is basic stuff, it is just the framework upon which you generate all your ideas, that's what the Econs dept doesn't tell you. I'm not sure abt other schools, but that's what makes HCI's Econs dept less than ideal"
Anonymous10001112,34,"Was from ASRJC.

What I liked:
- The teachers. Most of the teachers I got can teach well and care for the students’ wellbeing
- The people, had a class full of chill and funny people 
- The food, not super good but not bad
- The math department 

What I don’t like:
- CCAs are compulsory 
-  The GP department"
jdnhdjsj,32,"JPJC J2 student here

1) No homerooms. Our school has so few classrooms and yet they decided to accept so many students, so we have to move out of our classrooms after every lesson. Additionally, we have to walk around the whole school as our lessons are in different venues. How do they expect students to have a conducive place to study if they have to move around the whole god damn time


2) Awful administration. With the new j1s joining, there are so many students and the timetables are terribly made, causing the break times to clash and cause long queues 10-20 minutes. Moreover, the canteen is completely filled with nowhere to sit, hence we have to  bring our food to the classrooms to eat (we have to hope no one is using the classroom immediately after us so we can stay in it for a while). But guess what, we are not allowed to eat food in classrooms. Do they seriously expect us to sit on the floor to eat our food?


3) Late coming. If you are late, they will hold you at the concourse until assembly ends, so even if you would originally have only missed 1 minute of the morning assembly, well you will now miss 15 minutes of it. How efficient and productive

There are still many things I can talk about, but I will stop here for now"
MrRaisinBean,23,"Hi, from VJC Arts J3,

1. Academics wise, despite being known as a science school, the arts department is actually decent, although you do get the sense that the Science students gets a lot more opportunities, representation and attention from the school in general. 

2. As far as PW go (soon to be made irrelevant thanks MOE, VJ is known as the best school for PW and for good reason, consistent >90% distinction rate; the rigour of the entire PW team and the immense amount of effort the teachers put into reviewing the dozens of rounds of drafts, both official and unofficial is incredible.  Honestly you’d have to try very hard to not have an outstanding WR. 

3. With regards to the dreaded JAE/IP divide, unfortunately this is very real…as with most schools that accept both intakes. I was fortunate enough to not go through this personally because my class just so happen to be a primarily JAE class (16/19) but I do hear a lot of horror stories from my friends in other classes. Fortunately this situation definitely improves slowly, but surely as you go about your year.

4. I was extremely lucky to have incredible teachers (all except for 1 iykyk ;) ). Many people warned that in JC you’re thrown into the deep end and your teachers either are unable or unwilling to care about you, not just in terms of academics but also personal well-being. On the contrary, I’ve had some of the most caring and wonderful teachers throughout my 12 years of formal education thus far in VJC. 

5. In terms of school culture, I’m not sure if it’s because of COVID, but honestly the expectation and impression of VJC being wild is sort of misguided and exaggerated imo… what do I mean? Sure during events where the whole school gets together and dance you really feel as one with everyone, but these events are few and far between. The vast majority of your VJC life is honestly no different from how I would imagine any other school is like, so yes, work hard play hard?

6. On to the work hard aspect, since VJC consistently produce one of the best results at A’ Levels, pushing way above its intake weight in fact, naturally some classes have a very intense studying culture (mug), but this is definitely not representative of the entire school. Case in point: my class is so chill that one of our teacher literally unapologetically gave up on us and in fact frequently skips coming to class, because not only do we not do homework, we don’t even bother preparing for tutorials oops… fortunately we still performed outstandingly where it counts, despite being known as the worst class (in terms of academics) in VJC. 

7. One thing I absolutely loved about VJC is the SDL system, this is essentially an artefacts of the covid period, that is somehow being kept, and for good reason! Essentially for most subjects, especially math and econs, all the lectures are recorded and available online, meant for you to watch at your own pace, and at your own time, although a recommended schedule is provided, in order to keep up to speed with the tutorials. Initially it’s a bit hard to get used to, but after a while, this system is simply incredible because for the stronger students, they have every avenue to skip ahead and learn things in advance, and for everyone else they’re able to review things they forgot, or simply need a refresher on. Obviously this necessarily necessitates a bit of initiative, but trust me even the laziest of students (like yours sincerely) will benefit from this because imagine being able to learn the things from scratch using your phone a few days before your math exam LOL. 

8. Another thing VJC is famous for is it’s sports scene, my god…it’s way easier to just look at the few sports that VJ doesn’t bag everything than otherwise… enough said. The flip side to this however, is the fact that many of the most successful sports CCAs recruit almost exclusively through DSA, and unless you are extremely accomplished externally, it is difficult to enter through the “normal” route…many friends were extremely disappointed because of this rip. 

9. With regards to the campus and facilities…this is definitely a weak link because the campus is extremely old, in fact the first time I came near it, I genuinely thought that I came to an old folks home by mistake… Although there are some extremely unique things, such as the treehouses that are often used for publicity. Before you ask, YES YOU CAN USE THEM, free and easy and it’s honestly one of my favourite places to chill and talk with friends during breaks etc. 

10. On to convenience, VJC is REALLY very isolated from everything, it is quite literally in the middle of nowhere, although the benefit is the 5min walking distance to ECP. Connectivity wise it’s quite lacking if you’re taking public transport, a big stretch from the bus stops to the school gates are unsheltered so that’s not ideal. 

11. Food wise, I honestly think VJC’s canteen is excellent, I genuinely prefer it to many hawker centres outside LOL. There’s a joke from seniors that it’s a challenge to not gain weight in VJC simply because of how incredible the food is, like I still find it amusing that everything in VJ canteen is cooked to order like what??? Special mention to the 2 western stalls (yes..there’s 2 that sells the exact same items), the banmian stall with the friendliest aunty and the halal stall. Fun fact: one of the western stall owners hit the TOTO jackpot, became a millionaire overnight and quit!!!

12. Another big thing VJ has been pushing in the last 2 years or so is Student Initiated Groups (SIGs). This is one of my favourite things in my VJ life, if you have an idea that you think can gather like minded people and somehow benefit the larger student community, you are given many opportunities and support to start these “SIGs” as they call it. My batch was particularly interesting with notable ones being a Food Club, literally making FoodKing videos in school (@vjgastronomy on ig) and one that crochets beanies for cancer patients. 100% recommend trying this if you have a passion, you’d be surprised how rewarding it is, not just from the process but also when applying for university and  jobs etc. 

I CANT think of anything else right now, but if you have any questions at all feel free to pm me!

Edit: grammar"
f1nzyy,38,"truth being told, i just don't like being in jc 😭"
fishthejelly,17,"hihi! nj j1 here doing PCME. honestly it wasn't my first choice jc and my first thought when I got the posting was to appeal out to my first choice, but after a month of being here I'm starting to enjoy it here :D

for physics chem and math the lectures are all online which lets people learn at their own pace, which I feel is q good bc then I can rewind and copy down whatever I missed. some teachers may do live lectures but still record the lecture for students to  rewatch it anytime. I'd say the notes for the subjects aren't too bad, quite easy to follow but I wish they could print out notes for us like in sec sch instead of just posting them online and getting us to print it out ourselves T_T 

the food is pretty enjoyable too, personal favourites arey the yong tau foo and caifan, but the queues are super long 🥹 when the timetable first came out we only had half hour lunch breaks, along with the rest of the cohort... so if you get to the canteen late then must be prepared to wait atl 10min for your food or even the whole break for a single waffle :"")

the campus is super confusing, every time I need to get to somewhere I alw need to refer to the mini map that the school sent to us to navigate around the school because it's still so confusing hh by the end of my two years maybe I'll still be confused on how to get around :"") the j1 class locations are very strangely allocated so it's kinda hard to meet my friends from other classes at times huhu

I guess it differs from class to class but I quite enjoy mine :) it's not exactly close and there's the typical gender segregation but my class is v studious HAHA it motivates me to do work during free periods instead of just scrolling socmed or playing games 

haven't had any school events yet so sadly can't comment on that :( but I'm def looking forward to the ones coming up soon :D

so ig that's the likes and dislikes of sch life so far in nj ( • _ • )b hope it was worth the read!"
sardo_salem,14,"TJC j1 here,

what I like about the school: 

\- JAE/IP divide isn't too bad, most JAE people in my class are mixing relatively well with the IP people (37.5% IP, 62.5% JAE)

\- teachers most are quite funny and interact with the class when possible

\- PW lectures are online thank god it's all the stuff you learn in VIA in secondary sch so you can put it on 1.5x speed and finish faster

&#x200B;

what I dislike:

\- the timetable is absolute misery. and I'm not even one of the people in class who get 3 hour long breaks. praying it gets better next term but who knows lol

\- with the rain recently you can really tell the campus is dying, the number of dripping corners where the wood looks like it's about to collapse is a bit scary (not really of concern to next year students tho, since we're moving for renovation.)"
banheesoo_304,29,"haii, ej arts j1 here :) since i'm still relatively new to the school + busy with maths homework 😭, i'll keep this short and answer to the best of my ability hehe

- with regards to food, i heard from both my j2 seniors and my classmates that the duck rice sold at the canteen is nice. i also like buying food from the japanese and korean food stall, the auntie there is really cute and gives finger hearts as you collect your food 💗
- we also have a cafe, so sometimes when the canteen stall queues are very long and i'm lazy to queue, i just go to the cafe and buy something like macaroni pasta or sandwiches to eat ☺ the cafe also sells things like ice cream, wraps, apple lattice, tuna puff, coffee and ice mango tea, and my classmates have recommended the chocolate croissant to me 👍🏻
- however based on personal experience, one thing to note is that it can actually rain in the canteen 💀 the roof is quite high so if the wind is strong, it can blow the rain in and then you might get wet...
- with regards to subjects, i think maths, chem and bio all have pre recorded online lectures that you need to watch on your own, whereas lit, econs, history and translation have live lectures (e.g. in the auditorium or lecture theatres)
- and with regards to school culture, ej is quite nice and hyped 🔥 for example for valentine's day, the student councillors came to school early to give chocolates and sweets to students at the gates and around the school. there were also activities like bracelet beading and busking performances to watch, even our principal performed too! 🎤
- house culture is also quite strong here :D we have five different houses and during orientation, we had to learn the point dances of each house + our house's full dance + batch dance + college dance so that was quite a lot of dancing but i found it really really fun 😆💃🏻

overall although life is getting busier and more fast paced (or as one of my classmates likes to say, ""tuff"" 😂), i find life in ej quite fun and interesting, so there's that i guess 😉"
downvoteifsmalldick,9,"ASR  

Pros:  
- Great chem department. They give out so many resources and you can tell the teachers are genuinely passionate about the subject. There are many good teachers too, with some meh ones.  
- School cats. You may spot the cats occasionally if you walk by the side gate. There’s one that lets you pet it and is pretty affectionate (sniffed my hand and started rubbing its body on my legs).  
- Decent math department. It’s not the best, but they do give out a lot of resources too. The SRJC tutors are better than those from AJC, so just pray that you’ll get a good teacher. The good ones will make you look forward to math lessons. 

Cons:  
- Awful PW and GP departments. It’s seriously REALLY bad, the teachers are often shit, failing your GP exams/not doing well for PW is basically expected here. 
- Moving to the SRJC campus in 2024. ASR loses one of its pro, which is its location and accessibility.
- Shit campus. The auditorium always smell like piss, the tables in the lecture halls and auditoriums are on the verge of falling into hell. You WILL hear someone’s stationaries and notes falling every lecture because their table had failed them. There are also numerous incidents where the auditorium tables snap in half and people start waving them like a trophy. The classrooms look pretty rundown too, and I heard the ceiling in a lecture hall fell down recently. Only the JC2 block and the top floor of Block 1 has AC iirc. The AC in the auditorium breaks down pretty often. 
- Compulsory CCA with a lack of choices of interesting CCAs. 
- Pretty dead school culture. I think a lot of the hype depends on your class."
RandomDude_-,8, I'm curious to know how different JCs are conducting their lectures and their style of learning. Time management in JC is also so hard 😭
leafleafleafleaf__,37,"HCI J1 here. 

1. Strong Chinese culture. We sang mostly Chinese orientation songs and we placed our arms around each other while singing xinyao no matter whether we know the people or not. Very bonded HC community in the school.  Really wholesome. Oh and we even formed a long line by connecting with people from other class as we sing and danced to both Chinese and Taylor swift songs (HC’s addiction to Taylor swift is concerning haha). Really amazing campfire night. Truly a night to remember. Fell free to DM me if you want to see the actual videos of us enjoying SODACHE (HC’S song, dance and cheer segment) Finally for all HC J1s, 当你孤单你会想起谁？ 华初！
2. Mid food. The food is not very good but feel free to explore the three canteens if u have time haha. Of course it could be just my tastebuds… Oh n just to add the food here can be really expensive. E.g. cafe sells braised pork noodle for $6 but most of time it is between $3 to $5 in the normal college canteen. High school canteen food relatively cheaper. But I guess the cafe is really nice as it has aircon and long cushioned seats like an actual Starbucks cafe and many people love studying there. I also heard that u should avoid international sch canteen because prices can be rocket high.
3. Non existent Jae divide. Hci and NYGH kids r really nice. Made a ton of new IP friends!
4. Strong brand name of Hwa Chong and connections with overseas unis. Limited slots reserved only for HC students in top China University. Dedicated ecg department with inside information on admissions to US and UK universities. Top feeder schools to US/UK universities alongside RI.
5. Campus needs repainting and certain facilities r old. However, campus is very Chinese-influenced, feels really homely. Older classrooms are renovated and school is in the midst of building more lifts and renovating certain facilities which would be complete in a few months soon. Oh but we do have a ton of facilities here. Two gyms, two libraries, three canteens, huge track, a whole science research centre. And we do have aircons everywhere in classrooms (I think this is common in Jcs except NYJC if I’m not wrong) It’s nice and relaxing to study in but I need to bring jackets sometime haha
6. Econs department being bad is a myth. Teachers are dedicated and patient. Notes are also top-notch in the sense that there are wordy explanations to allow better understanding since there is more info and explanation.
7. School provides lots of opportunities for research (HCi’s own CENTAD research, OCIP for overseas exchange, lots of opportunities to participate in SL projects to farm CIP hours)
8. Academic results. Joined HC because of its top academic results. Take a look at A level results over the years. I.e. 2023 A level results -> HC beats RI with mean of 85 and 30% 90RP https://www.reddit.com/r/SGExams/comments/11551sg/a_level_results_2023_compilation/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=ios_app&utm_name=iossmf
9. I really appreciate how convenient the school is. It is literally right beside Tan Kah Kee mrt so it takes like only about 2 minutes to reach the assembly area especially if you are running late hehe.
10. I love the Chinese school song, it just screams Hwa Chong. I really like the Chinese culture if u couldn’t already tell. Search “Hwa Chong Institution school song” on YouTube for a listen. FYI the tune originated from Cornell University hahah
11. I do really appreciate the close-knitted community HC has and the fact that elitism is very much non existent. Everyone in HC helps one another :)
12. We also have one hour breaks so there’s lots of time to rest and eat or just mug, sometimes it can be 1.5 hours too. (PCME) 
13. But I don’t really like the fact that the faculties don’t compete anymore after orientation war games and it becomes very useless in fact, but oh well #4facs1hwach I do here from my seniors that the different faculties have different faculty events together! For example, faculty brunch or faculty outings. Plus we have lots of faculty merch! Stickers, pins, hoodies, shirts! 
14. To add on the school culture is really strong and the whole school literally comes together to do the school cheers and everyone is very hyped about it! Rock you is definitely an iconic one!

2. i know they say cj sci is bad, but i find it pretty alright! i take BCMg btw. my chem and bio teachers are actually pretty decent, my chem tutor esp gives hw every other day (i heard other chem teachers don't do this often) and my bio tutor is quite alright too, but not the best. at least they don't just read off the notes/ slides. math is good! my tutor even gives uni and life advice haha. idk about the other classes with supposedly shittier teachers but i think we got lucky. my pw tutor is good too. geog - it's good as well!

as for the notes, the bio notes are wordy and the printing is kinda wonky... haha. chem is okay? still decent. math is good.

1. The campus is really great. Even though some parts of the school are pretty old, generally it looks really new despite being one of the older jcs. It was actually part of reasons why I came here
2. The people are great. Maybe it’s just my experience, but most people I have met are really nice and friendly, especially the seniors. The atmosphere is not very stressful so far, because ppl here are not slackers but not muggers either, maybe because it’s still only J1.

Pros
Think the jc is relatively chill, like the promos are easy. There are not much extra classes or lessons during holidays unlike other JCs. Our PE lesson is also interesting as we get to try different sports. We have swim PE as well lol and gym sessions. 

Cons 
I think there are some cliques and popular groups in there which make the jc not the most inclusive but I think it happens everywhere.
You need to pay for gym and take part in school spirit stuff.
We have chapel every week an hour IIRC."

PlasticTourist3025,2,"Acjc j3 here :-)

Pros
1) I didn't come from any of the affiliated schools, but I still found it quite easy to make friends. Ofc there are some of 'those kinds' of people, but everyone is very friendly and supportive in general regardless of whether they're your close friend or not.  No ip-jae segregation, quite a diverse mix of students coming from diff backgrounds
2) nearing a levels, there are many extra lessons and timed practices in school which is vv helpful imo
3) I think school culture and spirit is quite vibrant esp during ori/nsg/acgames(basically a schoolwide sports event after j1 promos). And honestly acjc is not as party as what some ppl make it out to be, the top classes tend to be super mugger and it's quite common to see ppl studying in the canteen
4) makan bagus is the best stall 🤤🤤 but can be a bit ex like $5 for nasi padang 
5) a lot of the ccas (including sports and performing arts) don't need trials/auditions and they welcome beginners

Cons
1) the academic segregation is real. In other words, you're grouped into your class based on your L1R5.  The 'top' classes usually tend to be super mugger while the 'less top' classes tend to have more naughty people. As such I think it's harder to score well in a 'less top' class, but a couple of ppl still got 88-90rp so it's not impossible 
2) the physics department is actually quite ok, I think the pw department is more of a mixed bag bc a *lot* of ppl got B and I heard some teachers don't really do much
3) some of the sports/performing arts training schedules are quite extreme (like 3 times a week and end at 8-9+). It stops around the mye/promos period but carries on through the TA/CA period"
reiiichan,4,"acs indep y6 here! 

> campus

campus might look nice on the outside but stuff gets broken quite often, can't tell if it's shoddy construction or the extreme (?) temp changes (aircon is set to about 23 deg for the entire sch and almost everywhere is airconditioned) 😅

repairs also take forever, like the ib bio lab aircon broke down in sept '21 and was only fixed in nov '22 💀 and the level 5 ib block classrooms have had roof leaks since abt aug/sept '22 and they're still not fixed yet (as of mar '23) 💀💀

on the other hand, (unless ur like the poor intact class y6s stuck at the old block), most of your classes will be held within the ib block 🤩 so even if ur non intact and have to move around a lot, it usually isnt too bad in terms of walking to ur classes! (now is a bit different since all the level 5 classrooms are under repair so some classes are a bit further now :""))

this is a pro or con depending on the person, but as mentioned prev, basically everywhere is airconditioned, from the classrooms to the audi to the canteen (sac) to the mph to the labs, almost everywhere is aircon LOL. to me it is more of a con bc i cannot tahan the cold (my jacket almost never comes off when im in school bc so cold 😭😭) and soemtimes when ppl eat in class, the food smells linger for quite long :"")

> food

generally quite exp, (at least compared to my sec sch, but then again ✨inflation✨ soooo), a lot is 3+? but some is pretty good, like just for mee or noodle delight (crispy chicken noodle loml 😚👌👌). the oyako don from daijoubu (japanese stall) is always good too 

> teachers

i wld say that many of my teachers are quite good and willing to go the extra mile for us. some teachers are just quite onz in general and will push us for earlier deadlines/more practice. others are quite chill and just let u do ur own thing, but if u ask them for help, they will do all they can to help you 🥺🥺

ofc there are some teachers which dont seem to know what they're doing or are pretty unhelpful (ask for help or feedback they give u a vague answer 💀) but i guess every school will have a few teachers like that 🤷🏻‍♀️

> notes

only the chem math and language b notes are standardised (the rest rly depend on ur subj teacher) so i will only talk about those 😚

chem notes are actl pretty good and follow the subject guide so it is easy to follow when using other study resources. they're given topic by topic stapled, or in a ring booklet if the notes are quite long 👍👍

the math notes are okay but i hate how they're all given in one shot in this thick booklet which is perfect (?) bound so it's hard to lay open flat to use. last year, i resorted to tearing out the booklet into individual topics so it was less heavy to bring around and easier to lay flat, but this year i scanned every single page into a pdf to ink digitally 🤡🤡

dk abt the other lang b notes, but for chinese b, the notes are organised into the different topics so it's easy to revise and use 👍

> sch culture

it is a mission school, so expect pretty standard (?) mission school things like chapel and daily devotions. on top of that, teachers pray for us before exams/competitions and my cca opens with prayer (even tho our activities are pretty secular) 

ip/jae divide was kind of a thing early on since the ip ppl alr knew and met each other during the hi five programme but it's been a year on now and the ip/jae divide doesnt rly seem to exist much in my friend circles anymore. i do have some trouble interacting with some mgs ip girls since they alw seem so bonded w their clique, but that might also be bc im pretty introverted. and honestly, they're usually quite nice even tho it can get a bit awks soemtimes :'))

generally ppl here seem quite onz about their cca/external commitments, but going into y6, the ""ib grind"" env is becoming more of a thing with all the deadlines and submissions coming up

how mugger or how chill ur class is rly depends, altho at least from what i noticed, my friends with more group 4 hls tend to be more mugger compared to my friends with more group 1/3 hls (maybe bc u js need to bs well to do well for group 1/3 but idk 🤷🏻‍♀️) 

anyway if anyone has any questions abt acs indep or ib in general feel free to ask :)"
galaxystanddd,0,"Heyyy y’all,so please do not spit at me or anything but I am from YIJC,and tbh I love everything and everyone.The school campus is a bit old cause it was built a while ago.Like the bathrooms per level have like 2 cubicles and one is a western toilet while the other is an Indian toilet hence resulting in long ass lines.The canteen food is quite good and there is a variety,like clam chowder,squid ink pasta.We have good news cafe too.The school infrastructure is definitely falling apart considering that it’s quite old.The school spirit is really strong,and you are never judged for who you are in the campus at all.Some of the departments aren’t the best honestly like econs and PW as seen by the low distinction rates but we are getting through it.The math,Chem and GP department are quite good though in my opinion

Edit:the timetable is damn packed,the earliest I can go home is at 5.15,so it makes you exhausted by the end of the day.Also,another point I wanted to add is the location of the YIJC campus.I find it really isolated.As a person coming from the east,I feel scared walking around Yishun(no offence to anyone living there) the only place that is lively is Northpoint mall and the school itself."
rarararacoom,1,"hello rjc sci j1 here :) (hi friends pls don't doxx me) 

1.  imo ip/jae divide is not so bad? I was from ip and generally do know more people because of that, but I've had a lot of opportunities to mix around and everyone's been pretty nice! (jae people feel free to input!!) cause of the big batch size (around 1200 per batch, tho slightly lower most of the time), you'll always meet new people and as long as you're willing to put yourself out there, you'll find your people and meet plenty of acquaintances with diverse backgrounds in the process :D
2. elitism wise, it once again depends on who you choose to surround yourself with. thankfully everyone who I've met is quite down to earth despite many coming from well-off and/or sheltered backgrounds. (we even like to laugh at how extravagant some school-related things are together HAHA such as the orchird iykyk) most of us are like any other teenager tbh. I don't feel too pressured to constantly hang out with my friends all the time though, so as you stand firm in your boundaries, it should be fine :\]
3. I really like how near the school (esp jc campus) is to marymount mrt, and that it's fully sheltered too so I don't have to worry about getting soaked during rainy days -- a huge upgrade from secondary school for me 
4. many of you already know about gap day and though I've only started experiencing it, it's quite refreshing? messes up my internal brain schedule a bit but I have CCA every gap day so it's not that bad. I can't get extra sleep, but many of my friends do use that time to sleep in or catch up on work (one even went to malaysia during gap day lol) in a way you get a lot of freedom to plan the (extra) time you have weekly on that one day! There's also enrichment programmes during gap day and I don't think I'll be getting into one -- but if you're interested in them do definitely sign up cause they're super interesting and can be great exposure to many things out of academic syllabus 
5. can't really speak much for timetable because mine is great (since almost everyone takes the same subject combi in my class) but in general I end quite early (latest being 3:15pm, earliest being 12:30pm) my breaks are almost 1h too during longer days! Which gives me ample time to hang out with my friends and rest a little :) can forsee myself using this time to mug in the future haha 
6. as for mugger culture, I also can't give a very accurate imput because it definitely depends on your environment (some classes have v strong mugger cultures) and time (ie exam season) but there's definitely a fair share of playing and working for me as of now. In fact, we just had a carnival the other day and I think as long as you have the self-discipline to stay consistent in your work and manage your time well, it's a misconception that you can't have fun! 
7. the only big school event I've experienced is ori and it was amazing :"") raffles definitely has a super strong school culture so when everyone gets together to do school cheers the feeling is pretty electrifying and cool. house culture is also a thing so friendly competitions and the various initiatives planned also make school life less boring :D 
8. facilities are also not bad and sufficient for me! plenty of study spaces (my favourite being the library as of now) and places to hang out. while some of my friends have strong opinions on canteen food, I don't so nothing much to say but do definitely give the y14 canteen a try haha the waffles at y14 side chill are also amazing 10/10 recommend. get ready to climb a lot of stairs though... I'm so lucky to have my classroom be at raja 7 (literally the y14 side, and on the highest floor) jk but everyday is leg day here fr 
9. of course, as expected from a school full of high-achieveing students, imposter syndrome is so real and I've already had my fair share of that despite the short time I've been here. regardless, I've been reminding myself to do things at my own pace since as much as I'll be competing with everyone during A levels and in uni apps, it's better to not overexert myself and to just try my best, as jc is one big marathon :"") 

this is all I can think of from the top of my head but if anyone has anything to contribute feel free to reply + pm me for more info! atb to everyone in life haha its time for me to get back to my lectures too"
chuhuanggua,1,"CJC arts j1 here hehe
1. personally, i find it pretty difficult to make friends like maybe its just me (and/or my class) but the people are a bit awkward to talk to 😭😭😭 ofc sch has only just started so i cant rly.. form a solid opinion based on just the few weeks my class has spent tgt but ya :”D

2. the canteen is almost always super crowded so i haven’t rly been able to try the food there 😞😞😞 i did try the curry udon with tempura during ori tho!!! it was decent but i still prefer bringing my own food to sch

3. the tutors are all SUPER nice like genuinely so helpful and open to qns 😋😋😋 tbh! while i feel bad for saying this, almost all of them feel like a mega upgrade compared to my sec sch teachers lol

4. ELL!!!! one of the special parts of cjc is the fact that u can take english language and linguistics which i take 😝😝😝 so far, it’s been really fun (for me at least but ive been pretty interested in linguistics for a while so) and refreshing as a topic especially since u dont often see such a subject being taught in oth jcs!!! yaya fun

5. campus itself is kinda mid ngl 😭😭😭 like ik one lt is hving aircon leakages and my classrooms fans look like theyre abt to fall off the ceiling 😁😁😁 the campus IS pretty old tho (i think) so its understandable and its not like any of it rly affects how well we study n whether we’re able to concentrate or not lmao
PS: the library is so nice i love the library idc if its basic looking ☝️☝️☝️

ok yes rhats all im rly sleepy so im sry if anyth ive said is grammatically incorrect 😞😞😞"
Ok-Needleworker-8386,1,"ri sci (jae) here!

1. gap day. gap days are seriously the only reason i can tahan jc life 😭 i have something new to look forward to every week (no more monday blues too) and it gives me time to actually have a social life :"" 

2. online lectures. all our lectures are online and it's honestly a blessing because that means shorter school hours! sometimes i zone out when im too tired to function in school so having lectures that i can watch at my own time is really a lot better than dozing off in the LT... plus i can rewatch it whenever i need it for future reference 

3. school hours: not sure if its just for my class but id say we have pretty good school hours, probably a lot earlier than other jcs(?) for my class it range from 12-2.30, but if youre taking a weird combination (and h1 mt) then you might end earlier at maybe around 4 or so

4. opportunities: besides ri having a good record of studenys getting in top universities/courses, the school provided more than sufficient opportunities for holistic learning! the range of CCas, CE01s, RA/HP, WEPs. you'll definitely find something that suits your interest! also ri has a higher education dept that you can visit during y6! imo would be really helpful for uni application (as seen statistically too)

5. ip jae segregation/ just the people here in general: honestly am really shocked that the ip jae segregation is basically non-existent, as a jae kid i felt really included and ip kids there dont make being in raffles their whole personality (phew) i have to say tho, the only time the segregation is noticeable is when the rg girls walk past through hallways and have tons of people to say hi to, while i know none of them LOL 😭
undoubtedly, the people here are smart. REAL SMART. theyre either effortlessly smart or mugger smart. from my observation, ip kids are generally more 'effortlessly smart' in a way that they can catch concepts fast and understand things well (ESP RI BOYS), while the jae kids are more of the muggers. but even with the 'effortlessly smart' people, everyone here studies a lot 😭 fortunately everyone is willing to help me out with questions i have and thats rly nice :)

6. campus: GODDAMN THE CAMPUS is godly i love it. have yall seen the library?!?!? idrw to elaborate haha just come down to the next OH if youre interested!!! 
as for food wise, i havent tried a lot yet, i've only been to the prata and fruit stall and theyre rly good! usually i get my food from chill (the y14 waffles are a lot better) which has really affordable snacks as well! from what my friends say prof brawn (cafe) is pretty alright, they serve gong cha as well for the bbt lovers! do take note that they food there can be pricey tho ($5/6 per pax), (but they money goes to a good cause! iirc they hire people with special needs too)

7. self-directed learning: id say the raffles curriculum is more suited for those who have self discipline (as seen from online lectures, gap days, etc) for me its a pro bc i prefer to take charge of my own learning, but ymmv! iinw its a pretty new change where teachers are still transitioning into it, the school also mentioned that ri's 2022 a level performance kinda dropped so the teachers will be more mindful and keep an extra eye on us, if you're lacking behind, they'll probably talk to you about it

8. teachers & notes: the teachers here are all so nice 😭 really approachable and everything! no weird old lady karen whatsoever (except this one pw teacher from discipline dept... but she's thankfully not teaching me lols) the notes here are solid as well, i take bcme for reference! 

9. school initiatives: the school has a huuuuge budget so we have lots of event and activities that
you can choose to participate in between or after lessons! i think theyre all planned out by council, so if you plann to run, do take in mind that it's a lot of commitment! i wont elaborate on the activities held but u can check team raffles ig for more :)

edit: forgot to mention 9. school culture: imo we have a really strong house culture here! its nice to see everyone cheer their hearts out for their respective houses :)


cons:

- the school has 7 stories and mines on the 6th 💀(i know some schools have it higher but still this is a con to me) bro i dont have metal thighs i cannot do this everyday plus the campus is humongous + theres still the y14 side so walking from one end of the school to another takes me like 20 mins yo

- imposter syndrome is real 😭 when you think you're coping w school, in reality other are already done with the following week's work 💀 its really different from secondary school, when life and conversations were more than just academics. but this may be a prevalent thing in all jcs/tetiary institutions, but being surrounded by the top scorers around the nation will naturally make things a lot more stressful, i constantly have to reassure myself that i'm doing fine :"" 

i scored nett2 for o levels, which essentially guaranteed me access to any school in singapore. i've contemplated between schools like ny and hwach and feared that i would make the wrong choice but till today, i dont regret my decision! 

btw i apologise for any typos or errors i made above its almost 3am and i have school tmr i took way to long to type this out lol"
ijuswannadowellbruh,19,"honestly my results were pretty stellar in jc1, but things went downhill throughout j2. id attribute this to the increased difficulty of exam questions and simply more topics to learn and grasp as compared to the previous year.(like srsly no joke bro) i didnt do as well in j2 also because i kinda slacked on homework and lectures here n there at the start being an ogl and all, so needless to say i fell behind pretty badly. In j1 i really forced myself to find interest in the curriculum and pay attention at all costs hoping success would come naturally, and it kinda did work because i genuinely enjoyed econs but i just found macro so repulsive in j2. 
one thing im glad i did is find a group of close knit friends that worked hard and played hard, i could always rely on them for help with homework, lectures etc and play mobile games with them to destress.
a little regretful that i neglected gp throughout jc to a large extent(MY STAND, P2 SKILLZ OR ISIT 1 IDER ANYMORE), i paid more attention to my other subjects instead(which i thankfully did well in for a's). however this thought of 'damn my rp couldve been higher' continues to linger in my mind lah.

tldr:exam questions hard, need good time management, pay attention, surround urself with positive influences and care equally for all your subjects so you dont regret down the road"
Zealousideal_Fold823,15,"i feel u need the mindset that failing is NOT common. Once you do well once, you will feel motivated and continue doing well."
akcu,11," at jc u need to practice > memorising (esp chem!!) 
fast pace of jc greatly diffentiates sec sch to jc so u can let shit snowball + get use to the issue of alw having a backlog u cant clear (but u must plan to do the current stuff and clear them at the same time as much as possible)

also cannot just stare at qn just bc udk how to do like learn to skip, consult, ask and honestly dont skip lessons (ik alot of ppl think its fine to skip lectures... it really isnt imo even if its boring)

j1 mainly need time to ease into it dont give up LOL play hard study hard bro consistency is key even a 15mins a day adds up to alot by the end of the yr and its better tham force feeding info near exams

also try to consolidate notes after each chapters (i regretted not doing this this is esp impt when u reach j2 cos udh time to restudy everything (i mean u will need to but uw to minimise that time cos the content is ALOT.)"
MrRaisinBean,8,"I’m assuming you’re from sci stream so my input may not be so useful to you for the most part, but could help others (I was from arts). 

Unpopular opinion: studying and working hard is overrated 

Throughout my 2 years in jc i Found that for humanities subjects, working hard, studying and revising etc is completely unnecessary and don’t REALLT do you any good. Case in point, memorising your content for history for instance months before your exam is a complete waste of time, because by the time your exam comes around, you would’ve forgotten most if not all of the content. During your normal school days you should focus on mastery of skills, without which you’d be hard pressed to do well even if the exam were to be open book, and honestly once you master said skills, it’s not difficult to do decently well even with barely any content knowledge. 

For econs, it’s very important that you REALLT understand the concepts, don’t bother too much with memorising, sure if you’re lucky and a similar questions comes out you hit the jackpot but chance of which is rather slim. 

I observe that the general trend for alvl subjects is really the need to understand, this is particularly beneficial to students who really enjoy the learning process, and not just study to prepare for the exams, because when you really appreciate the concepts, doing well comes naturally. This is quite the contrast from olvl, where you can do well in most subjects by simply working hard

Personally I haven’t done a single piece of homework in my 2 years, and did 0 revision except for just before exams and still managed to do well, and this seems to be the case for many of my friends too, so REALLT pay attention to your tutorials and don’t worry so much about “working hard”! 

Although, for me the exception was math, which as usual requires practice"
Dibromohexane,1,"sci stream j3 here;
i guess it is indeed difficult to maintain an A grade for all subjects throughout the year because of your commitments (CCA, student-initiated learning, student-interest groups etc) taking up quite a portion of your time. as such, you probably won’t have time to consolidate your learning and understand fully the material. however, it is possible to secure As for major examinations and these are the main examinations to study for anyway. studying hard itself is not sufficient in jc as the focus for most of the sciences is on application and not fully memorise-and-regurgitate, and so you should aim to practise more to condition yourself to novel questions and yourself to draw on the correct content as fast as possible."
RandomDude_-,1,As a j1 I find the pace too fast all of a sudden. The questions seem ok but econs and GP is hard for me because there's quite some stuff to self study for econs and I'm just not very good at GP

Resident-Ad-1059,45,can't ans ur qn but I'm facing the same problem bro
smolnfloofy,15,you need to be able to distill the important concepts from your notes. requires practice. esp for the earlier jc1 topics such as atomic structure and chem bonding - if you’re v familiar w the topic you can look at a qn and know exactly what concept they’re testing because it’s usually pretty standard

RandomDude_-,2,I also have this problem where I struggle to understand certain concepts and how they work
AffectionateAd4523,2,It’s very normal and u are still adjusting to jc rigour .It happened to me too but only for certain qns . We cannot expect the notes to spoon feed us everything . The examples in the notes are very easy at least for my school so it didn’t really help me . I think the best way is to listen during tutorials when tutor is going through and learn from ur mistakes never repeat them ever
drizzledmochi,1,i think it’s normal for some qns only.
The_Wobbly_Guy,1,"Assuming you are diligently checking the notes but the info is just not there, then it could be poor package design. Better constructed notes and tutorials go from the basics, to more advanced, then to novel questions operating on the same broad principles.

OTOH, some students expect to be spoonfed the exact same questions. It doesn't work that way either.

So look at your notes again. What are the key concepts you are expected to learn? How can you apply these concepts to the questions in the tutorial?"

GloxyVI,19,"Guys can develop feelings at any given time.  Most will usually start taking it seriously (for both genders) around university period.

Just tell them you need to study for your 'A's and that your parents don't approve lor. If they are serious, they can wait. Of course don't be disappointed if they start distancing after that, it's like investment la. If I invest, I hope for ROI. No ROI then no invest."

maybe some part of them also kanchiong later cannot get gf hahaa scared the girl they like get snapped up

but up to you, still prioritise studies first ok, if in a relationship, you should support each other, not distract each other

90rp is forever

just tell them that you are focused on studies now and are not looking for a relationship at the moment. Then it's a gd time to gauge their responses. If the guy shows signs of dislike or do negative stuff like scolding you, or keep persuading/pestering you that a relationship is more impt, red flags.

Note that some ppl may just confess out of peer pressure, that they think having gf is cool and all, gg ns w a gf makes other guys jealous, and treating it as a competition. So tbh focus on studies first, not worth to get affected by childish ppl also, if you are unlucky

suishan,6,"Hi! I’m currently considering a gap year and awaiting graduation from polytechnic from a healthcare diploma~ i’m interested to take up occupational therapy particularly followed by physiotherapy in university. I have tried applying for university this year but my chances are slim, hence planning to take the gap year.

I have applied for therapist assistant role in hospital , and community. but hoping to secure the job role in an hospital.. because my diploma is quite generic, so not sure if I can get into the therapist assistant role..
applying this therapist assistant role as a gap year to boost my portfolio, for admission if I re-apply next year.

hopefully I get into the role, but wondering if I should expand my options but also I want to do a role related to therapist that will be helpful for my admission next year..

any suggestions? and general advice will be appreciated 👍"
nameless9123,6,"I am a healthcare worker (AHP). Can I ask what you think about ""quiet quitting""? Given that the pay increment for a good performance grade is minimal and the difference in pay increment between an average grade and a higher performer wouldn't make much of a difference, weighing out the sacrifice needed to work out of working hours. We all know in the long run, the pay is not fantastic for the amount of work and constant grinding to hone our clinical knowledge alongside with our additional admin work on top of our case loads."

In Australia most of the nurses are given a shot at PR.

reiiichan,2,"hellooo thank you for doing this AMA! 

im a j2 student who is interested in healthcare but not quite sure what course i wanna go into yet. currently looking into nursing, but if u know about the other healthcare roles, id like to hear about them too :)

1. is there a lot of paperwork involved in nursing? i know for sure i dont want a desk job bc i get restless and bored easily doing paperwork ;v;;;;

2. is it hard being in nursing (or healthcare in general) as an introvert? i love helping people and getting to know new people but im so awkward sometimes and i get nervous easily so im wondering if that'll make me a bad fit for healthcare 🥺

3. im also in the midst of getting diagnosed for adhd and im worried that it might make me a bad fit for healthcare? 

4. i heard that in nursing you get to choose specialties and change specialties, how does that work? do some specialties have prerequisites for joining? i read somewhere that emergency nursing needs 1y bedside experience but idk if it's legit or not 😅

5. what's the career progression for nurses (or hcw in general) like? also, is there a difference in pay or seniority if you graduate with BSN or BSN (hons)? 

6. kinda related to the above point but i heard that you can do a masters in nursing to become an APN (like the ""ward sisters"" in ""you can be an angel""?). im curious as to how long it takes (as in how many years of work experience) and is it like the tv show? id much prefer to care for the patients than manage other and do paperwork, so im worried that i dont have a lot of options for career progression in nursing:"") 

thank you so much for your time ;v;;;"

Critical-Grape-6165,2,I dont think there is dae for o level students though.. i might be wrong. Im only certain that np only does dae for A level students which the window just closed a few days ago. :(
bananapeelwww,1,Bump! Need to know something similar too
Unique-Push-3843,8,"1) as a pure geog taker, i personally disliked the subject. memory work was heavily relied on, and the expectations from sec 2 to 3 was really a really drastic increase. i used to score full marks for ldqs in sec 2 but as i entered upper sec, i was only scoring 5, 6 marks. even after i graduated i still have no idea how to score full marks for ldqs. your content must be memorised, mastered and understood.

2) not too sure about hist, but geog's content is more than lit. partly because geog is 60% memory work, 40% analysis, whilst lit is the opposite. i believe there wouldn't be too big of a difference in terms of the hard work you have to put into either subjects though.

3)technically true. but ultimately people in triple science are the hardworkers. in my school these are the top scorers who goes to ri hc. so i'll let you be the judge of that.

4)theoretically, double is more safe, provided if you are good at the humanities subjects. do also consider what courses you might want to take in the future, especially jc. personally, i didnt have the luxury of options to choose from as i didnt take physics in secondary school. so biology it is, though the subject is not of my interest anymore...
in general, i dont really think theres a major disadvantage of taking double sciences, other than the above mentioned.

5) in elective literature, it is not open book. there are two sections of a paper.
Sections A: three qns, choose 1 to ans. two qns are going to be based on your content knowledge and how much analysis u have done before. one qns has passage given, and usually they'd ask for your impressions from the passage, and a qn you have to ans from your memory of the book
Sect B: two poems, choose one to ans
if my memory didnt fail me, it is very similar to lower sec lit. marking standards are definitely higher.

6) -

7) from what i hear, most schools have bad physics department. however, it really depends. are the results produced by the students bad during internal exams? o levels? do the teachers not answer the students' qn? if you are interested in the subject, i'd highly suggest you not to listen to what others say and just follow your instincts.

8)not really no, if you were offered hcl, cl should be pretty easy to score in. because if you think about it, many people of the same age are taking cl as their mother tongue, and most people would suck at that language. some may even leave it blank. so if you can speak the language decently, you are able to read and write chinese  characters, the bellcurve will work in your favour. i did not actually studied for any of the papers, and i actually thought i would score a b3 for the subject based on the calculations i made. but i still got a1 for it. bellcurve does exist.

9) yes, do not expect the standards of lower sec to be placed onto upper sec. other than e math, everything else will have a significant increase of difficulty. if you are an a math taker, expect failures. dont be too disheartened though, because it's very likely your school is trying to scare you into studying and make sure you are prepared. right up till prelims i was still scoring d7 for a math but was still able to secure an a2 for o's. ofc, the change doesnt come overnight, but gradually your teachers will pile up more work on you.

10) i studied a month before o levels, all whilst being addicted to netflix and ig. still managed to secure l1r5 nett <10. rn in jc, the amount of work i put in daily is the amount of work i put in daily during the month of o levels. o levels really isnt that difficult, unless you let the things you dk snowball throughout the two years, you shld be safe. imo, dont need to put too much pressure on yourself.

Rn in sec 2, focus on every single subject. Including subjects that you dislike. 

Geog - memorise. sec 2 geog is all about memorising and puking it out during exams.

Hist - memorise. sbq follow format. lower sec teachers love it when u follow the format. dont try anything advance. srq memorise. sing the historical stories to yourself.

Lit - memorise shot phrases and analyse them to the best of your ability. then go for consults. ask the teacher if you are along the right path.

math - practice. dont know must ask!!

science - read the textbook. make notes. practice qns

english - read widely. use extravagant words in essays. follow formats for comprehension. annotate extensively.

arts, dnt, fce - have fun in these subjects. you will miss it once you head up to upper sec.

chinese - variety shows and books. languages are hard to master unless you use it often."
idontlikepracticals,3,"1. Not sure since I didnt take pure humans but from what I heard from my friends, the funny thing is, they felt that elect hist had more content than pure geog, though Im not sure how true that is.

2. Imo geog is the easiest to score, you just need to memorise the content and practise your data base qns, and youre set to do well (but again I dont take hist or lit so take this with a pinch of salt)

3. okay welllll, id say take trip science if you still arent sure if you like physics or bio more. Because for my friends who took double sciences and went on to jc, they had no choice but to continue studying that same science. I also heard in h2 physics, you gotta be familiar with upper sec physics or else itll be a struggle (however all my pcme friends rn actually think physics is the easiest among all the subjs they take rn). I take h2 bio and honestly, I find bio pretty difficult because of the amt of content you gotta study. 

So id say, take trip sci if you have no idea whether you like physics or bio. Yes, one humanities is risky, but if you work hard, you should be able to score your A1.

4. Disadvantages of taking double sci (the only one i can think of rn), eg if you took pure bio in upper sec, and wanna take h2 phy in jc, it’s gonna be a struggle + theres also diagnostic tests you gotta take to see if you qualify for the h2 subj to begin with.

8. I found cl o’s pretty doable actually, like the paper 2 was quite ok compared to hcl paper 2💀💀as long as u do ur cl tys u can prob secure your a1! 

9. Sec 3 was definitely more tiring than sec 2, however the biggest change for me was English. My english went from an a1 in sec 2 to b4 during my s3 t1 WA💀 eventually I still did decently for english in o’s but yeah english is pretty tough

10. I started studying for o’s in june (just doing e math tys), then full on mugging in early sep. Im really satisfied with my score so yay ig

Rn in sec 2, you dont have to be mugging constantly since quality> quantity. Enjoy your time in sec 2 and just make sure you understand whatevers going on in class. Dont sleep and pay attention, revise before exams and youll definitely do well enough to choose your dream subj combo. You got this :)"
benedictbenadryl,3,"1. i took pure lit and i enjoyed the subject a lot! i believe that for lit as long as you put in the effort to submit assignments and actively participate in class, you’ll score just fine :) 
2. in pure lit you study one book and one play. i think that compared to the other two pure humans, lit has probably the least content?
3. depends on what you think you’re stronger in/have a stronger interest in! the combined humans syllabus isnt that challenging imo, so you dont have to worry too much abt screwing it up. instead you shld choose based on what subj you prefer
4. well depending on what you take, the content is pretty heavy. ik some of my classmates couldnt cope very well with elect geog + pure hist and dropped pure hist altogether. triple science does also tend to open more doors than double humans does, though it all comes down to what you would like to do in the future!
5. lit is not open book, the only time they give you the text is in the passage based questions. youre expected to know the books very well and be able to quote lines from the book to support your points.
6. uhh HAHAHAHA cant say for pure hist, but for elect as long as you knew the timeline of events + the rough dates/details of the events, it was good enough to get you an A.
7. THIS ONE I PERSONALLY RELATE TO!! i had a not-so-great physics cher during my sec sch days, and i was constantly borderline passing my WAs. to study for Os, i used the 1001 mcq book and used it intensely, esp for the topics i was weak in. i did my tys religiously and managed to get an A2 for Os! so all im saying is that even if your teachers arent so great, there’s definitely ways to score good by working hard( and smart ) on your own :)
9. the change was quite manageable for me?? i think? but a lot of my friends found it a shock and didnt cope very well :( eventually you get used to it tho hahah
10. ill be honest and say that i really only started SERIOUSLY studying during the june hols 💀💀 before that i was doing sone light revision, but nothing outside of what i usually did. given my improvement in grades from myes to Os, im pretty happy w myself! i really think that it came down to studying smarter, and not necessarily harder."
GG-Complaint-30,2,"1)Can't say since I take combined humans

2)can't really say for sure but both hist and geog have quite alot of content. Idk about lit

3)I take double sci so can't really say but it depends if you are better in humans or sci. For me I'm quite good at both so its fine for me but chances are its different for yo

4)Double sci would basically limit you to one sci so no bio if you take phy assuming that chem is a must though I would say that it has a lesser workload than triple

5)Can't answer that since I take his/ss

6)History is pretty easy if you remember important dates and events and the format on how to ans questions. I would highly reccommmed watching  oversimplified on youtube as it helps alot.

7)Don't know how to answer that. Go with what your heart and mind says

8)Can't answer that since I'm malay

9)For me yeah it is. Longer timetables,more homework and more subjects to study will be very overwhelming for the first few weeks but you will get used to it by the second half of term 1

10)Not taking o levels but I think starting about sec3 december holidays to memorise important concepts and practice before sec 4."
One_Lake5517,2,"6.) Hist can be quite easy if you study and understand the content. Yes granted there's quite a bit of memory work involved, but for a few events, you can use the same explanation to explain your answer. Dates wise there's no need to rmb every single date, just the key events, sometimes Cambridge will put dates in the sbq qn to try and trick u"
Actual_Exit_1477,2,"1) all 3 have their own difficulties. best to choose base on ur strength and passion HAHA. i believe the passion will keep u going in the long run. at least it helps a little. personally , i took pure geog. loved it even tho there’s alot of case studies to remember. on the other hand , i heard alot of pure hist students saying pure hist is a killer 

2) both geog and hist has alottt of content. u will always see the geog and hist students mugging right before the exam while lit students js chilling at one corner. 
 
3) only take triple sci if ur v strong in ur sciences & prepared for the v heavy workload + v good time management. with that having said , u can always drop one of the sciences if u rly cant cope later on. tbh triple sci is not necessary. 
yes u need a humans in ur L1R5 for jc. poly I’m   not too sure cuz diff courses hv diff requirements / relevant subj. most ppl tend to neglect their humanity sooo u needa balance out. 

4) hmm again , chose ur subj base on ur strengths and interest. yeaa indeed double sci is more safe. it keeps ur options open. a useful combi especially if ur aiming for sci stream in jc. i think the disadvantage is only hving 1 humans ( like my previous sec sch didn’t offer pure humans with double sci ). u CANNOT neglect ur humans. that’s a mistake that lots of ppl make. in the event that ur drop from pure sci to combine sci , u are left with 6 subj only. on the bright side , combine sci will prob be way easier for u. 


5) lit o lvls isn’t open book. from what i heard from my lit frens , o lvl paper will be a v thick booklet and u flip to the book dat u did. u may wanna go to the seab website to look at the syllabus. 

6) gotta say that the jump from lower sec hist to upper sec hist is v huge. upper sec hist is wayy stricter. the sources also requires more thinking. It’s not just abt memorising.. it’s abt the way u structure ur ans as well as how u put ur points across. VVV impt to explain and link back to the qn. u shld be fine after getting the hang of it :D 
a great tip is to make a timeline for all the dates and events for every chapt. it’s clearer that way. 
um back in lower sec , history was my strongest subj. everything went downhill during upper sec 🤣🤣🤣 my pure geog was damn good while my elect history was dying. i loved the content for hist tho.

7) u can always seek external help ( tuition ) / asking ur frens / self study. hm im q sure ur chers will help u out so might wanna try consulting them first. u also shld see the syllabus for bio and ask urself whether u wld be fine with learning whatever that will be covered. 

8) can’t answer becuz i didn’t take hcl xD 

9) the change is drastic. back in lower sec , u can get A’s / above average grades despite js whacking ur way thru. u can’t do that for upper sec. the most drastic change to me wld be english. upper sec english is a whole new lvl :”


edit : SORRYY the formatting is so bad cuz im typing on phone"
PlasticTourist3025,2,"2) I feel like geog needs the most memorising(I took elect geog

3/4) might be biased here, but don't take trip science unless your school allows you to drop one humanities or you're really passionate about science. I was double science but I knew trip science people...their workload is kind of extreme imo.  Also in jc (if you want to go), you can only do either physics or biology with chem, so trip science has no benefit unless you're not strong in your humans and want another subject as a safety net for L1R5.  In summary: don't kiasu 😳

5) lit is not open book in o levels, and the text is only provided for pbq. However, it is open book in a levels (that is if you're planning to go jc and take lit there)

7) even if you have 'bad' teachers, you'll have friends who do better and you can always ask them. In fact, it's easier to ask your friends whom you see every day in school. Ofc you also have tuition and reddit notes hahah 

8) took o level hcl in 2020. You're prob gonna do the paper next time and imo it was super hard 💩💩 but I still got a b3. My tip: answer all the qns, even if you don't know just anyhow write smt that makes sense.  If you leave qns blank ofc they'll give you zero marks

Edit: I forgot whether I saw my seniors getting their results LMAOO but I think this could possibly happen given the easing up of covid measures. Also I realised you were asking abt express chi here and not hcl, tbh I think it was quite easy, I took cl in 2019 (standard for most of the o level cl papers)

Advice: good that you're thinking far, I prob didn't even care abt these things in sec 2. For now, take time to identify your strengths and weaknesses and just try to do well in your exams.  In sec 3 you'll prob have a much clearer idea on what you want to do in the future!! I think the other redditors have v good answers too so I'll leave it here ATB yeah 💪you can ask me if you have any more qns"
Actual_Exit_1477,2,"10. my studying habits were way better as compare sec3. i wasn’t consistent tho. ended up only grinding seriously after prelims. ( not the way to go ) my l1R5 is mediocre. ik my o lvl results not that good la HAHA but tbh im quite proud of myself for the huge jump in grades for certain subjs. it was a big jump from my prelims as my L1R5/4 for prelims was horrendous.



dun hv to worry so much about it now okays. take it slow :D just do what u need to do , pace urself , hv confidence in urself and u will be fine. consistency is key 🙌🏻"
jessychee,2,"1. took p geog and elect hist not pure hist but imo hist was easiest to score, IMO sbq was a life saver bc i could easily do well for it wo studying, got all As since sec 1 except for 1 test, but diff people have diff strengths so take it as you will.

2. Idk who can advise u on this bc no one took all 3 but i would tell u that geog was a pain to study for if u dont have interest

3. I took trip sci and double humans since my sch offered it, but i rmb one of my classmates who got consistent A1s for ss/hist who got B3 for Os and even though she got As for all of her subjects, only managed to score 8. Again, take it as you will

4. There is no “safe” option imo, just take what you like and is passionate about. I would say the trip sci culture in my class was one of the reasons i did well for Os though. If i didn’t have classmates I could rely on to ask qns, I wouldn’t have done well.

5. I dont take lit

6. tbh i think it depends on ur sch and cher, my cher rly taught us the shortcut methods to answering. but i feel like having a very logical reasoning helps u to do well, not just memorising dates(i didnt do that)

7. Um i was kinda opposite, had a really bad bio cher but rly good physics cher. IMO, bio is easier to self study content, but hard to cross reference proper answering phrasing if u dont have the right resources and answer keys. Phy is harder to self study but easier to get good resources off the internet and also easier to practice and judge whether u get a qn right or wrong

8. whether smth is easy is subjective but i rmb being so worried abt my grades and still getting an A1, majority of the ppl who put in effort did well but there were still some Bs in my HCL class. No point worrying about it, just work hard.
And no, i was not w my seniors bc it was covid, i oso drmb collecting w sec 3s when i was collecting my O result. Might depend on ur sch tho

9. Cant rly say much bc its so long ago but i rmb alot of ppl failing during the first test (its completely normal dw) and taking some time to get used to the workload, but eventually everyone got used to it
I would say now that im transitioning into J1, the transition feels 10x worse bc its a big sch and new environment and everyth so the transition to sec 3 pales in comparison, so i might be downplaying how easy/hard the transition was

10. I was consistent. Studied fairly consistently throughout sec 3 and start of sec 4, but studied abit more closer to Os, ended up doing very well and everyone kind of expected that from me. Would recommend being consistent, altho i do know a few ppl who only started closer to Os and still did relatively well, but they rly mugged like hell and made their lives miserable, + they had alot of tuition and good resources

Lastly, just enjoy sec 2. Participate in competitions that u r interested in if you can, will rly help in ur portfolio and getting selected for diff programmes in JC, esp when it seems as if u still dk wat areas of study u r interested in yet, at least if u decide to join sci research/ humanities programme in jc u hv smth to show. Once u enter sec3/4, u would notice how easy sec 2 was but they say u look at ur past through rose tinted glasses or smth"
Sure-Shine-4257,2,"3. I take triple science, but only because i am a very science inclined student :') I just cannot with humans, its not my thing. so the advantage for taking trip science for me is that i can score much better for 3 science 1 humans compared to 2 science 2 humans. another advantage is much less content to memorise like for physics its mostly understanding concepts and applying them to different questions, compared to lets say pure geog which would require memorising 4 different textbooks worth of content ToT. But its really really dependent on each person, what might seem like an easier path to me might be the complete opposite to someone else so i think the best thing to do is understand what you enjoy the most and go from there :)

6. I only take elective history but i would say history is definitely not just memorizing dates and answering in a format. It's more of being familiar with different events and the different reasons why they took place. In lower sec you could very clearly know what questions they could ask based on the textbook, but in upper sec questions such as essay questions are a lot vaguer, and its more about applying the knowledge you know to fit the question. Same goes for SBQ, In lower sec you could probably infer from the source without knowing any prior knowledge and still get full marks, but in upper sec you have to know specifically where the source fits in the timeline and only then you would make a correct inference while also providing contextual knowledge in your answer

this is definitely not to scare you away from history, bc personally i find it v enjoyable and interesting! but yea i think you should get an idea of what you're signing up for in upper sec if you do take history :) you can dm me if you have any other questions"
jisuniverse1123,2,"1. hii a pure geog (and elect hist) taker here! imo i would feel geog is easier compared to hist and lit although thats just my opinion 🫠 i actually struggled more with human geog than physical geog for some reason but if you take the time to memorise, write ur own notes and also consult ur teacher on the types of questions you don't understand, you def would get the A 😂 

2. honestly idk, being a double humanities student workload is CRAZY but it was my choice so 🤣

3. if u want triple science i hope ur more science inclined than humans inclined imo if ur better at humanities than sciences go for double humans instead of triple sci

4. as a double sci (pure phy, pure chem) student i struggled LMAOO my sciences were nvr the best as i struggled with phy a LOT. for chem my grades declined in sec 4 to the point i had to drop to combi sci (phy/chem) if u actually cfm cannot double sci in sec 4 it would be good to drop to combi less stress imo 

however double sci would always be the safest route for almost everyone imo it'll be better for u to decide between the subjects u would take in the future in jc (if ur going there) double sci wasnt really my thing but i had to do it together with double humans as well so it was kind of a pain in the ass 🤧

5. cant answer since i didnt take lit

6. imo hist was fairly ok? skills and whatnot would be the same from what u learnt in lower sec but it'll be upgraded a little in terms of the number of skills u need to learn. however content would be drastically different since it'll be abt world hist instead of sg hist

7. if teachers are bad ig u should do bio u would have to do a lot of selfstudy if the teachers dont teach well if not u'll actually fall behind. for me, my phy teacher was quite gd but i just couldnt get myself to understand physics 💀everything was so confusing and i kind of gave up LOLL the answering techniques were fucking crazy im not kidding all the time i thought i answered correctly only to find out it was wrong because i didnt know shit 💀💀💀

8. cant answer cos i dropped hcl in sec 2 LMAOO

9. hmmm i would say yes definitely there will be a lot and i actually mean A LOT of work because teachers would try to finish a lot of the syllabus in sec 3 so that there'll be less teaching in sec 4 since they would want to focus on revision (like doing papers) in the later part of sec 4 just before mye iirc. i slacked a lot during sec 3 and it wasnt the best decision i made HAHAHAH i had to buck up in sec 4 a lot

10. i was a serious procrastinator 🤣 i only started studying properly during prelims and more seriously after prelims (because the grades didnt come out gd LMAO) i wrote out notes for pure geog and combi sci (phy/chem), memorised formulas for e math, a math and combi sci (phy/chem) and ofc read pre-prepared notes for combi humans (ss/hist) that my teachers had gave us before the study break

i focused on geog the most. i told myself i had to buck up from the e8 i had gotten during prelims and get the a1/a2 i needed. u have to do notes, remember steps and procedures for gi and def consult ur teachers on qns u did that u dont quite understand. the consult sessions for me were actually really helpful and the days where i finally did notes for geog during my study break into the night paid off actually and imo i would think i did pretty decent for my o levels after receiving my results (my geog was the only a1 i gotten during os which i was damn happy abt) i was actually quite happy with my results but wished i was more math and sci-inclined because all of them were b3s 💀 my humans and english were all as but cl was a b3 LMAOO but i was fine with them 😌

anyways, atb to u op for ur upper sec journey and os! it would be hard but u can do it! 👍🏻"
reedit1332,2,"Hello, I took O Levels last year and I can answer some of your questions

1. In my personal opinion, pure Geography, once you memorize a decent bit of content and more importantly understand how all the concepts come together then you can basically answer every question in the paper. It's relatively content heavy but not that difficult. The bellcurve is generous as well if you care about that. I can't speak on Literature however pure Geography is definitely much easier to score than pure History imo.

2. History

3. I would personally not reccomended that you take triple science. Between physics and biology, choose the subject that you are more interested in, or choose the one which you feel you can score better in. Personally I'm glad I didn't take triple science, because I scored an A2 for SS/History, however thankfully I scored an A1 for Pure Geography (I take double humanities double pure science) which means I didn't have to use my SS/History.

4. As for the disadvantages, honestly, I can't think of any, but if you're really good at all 3 sciences triple science will be a more optimal choice. Just remember that you may be bottlenecked by your combined humanities.

6. History is a lot of memory work, and that automatically makes it relatively difficult. Yes, you will have to know how to answer the questions as well, and develop strategies for SBQ questions if you want to score well (SBQ makes up quite a big chunk of total marks). Of course, my main gripe with history (and SS) is time management, since I always struggle to finish my paper due to so little time being given. Geography is better when it comes to time management.

7. Don't choose a subject based on how good the department is. If you prefer physics over biology, just take physics. Who knows, maybe you'll get an amazing teacher.

9. No, the jump is not that drastic.

10. I could make an entire post just to answer this question alone, however the most important thing I have to share is, don't be like me, start revising early. You don't have to do anything in sec 3, but it's best to start grinding at the start of Sec 4. Of course, pace yourself so you don't burn out. I can't share anything about studying in sec 2 becuase I slacked my entire lower sec lol.

Hope this helps."
ineedurgenthelp-05,2,"3. in a sense yes, but personally was from trip sci and it was useful for me because in sec 2 i wasn't sure if i preferred bio or physics but after going more in depth into the 2 subjects i decided i didn't like bio as much. and also i really enjoyed geog+ss so it was easier for me

9. yes. content suddenly gets super heavy, more hw etc. and add on that in sec 3 you'll be leading cca student leadership etc. will take a few months to get used to

10. um ok personally there is no time u start studying for o levels bcs content from sec 3 is tested. i just studied for the WAs and sch exams that helped me rmb content alr. but full on revising content, i'd say after june holidays? and i started tys like during sept hols? i managed to finish tys for most subjs except amath, geog(i just wrote down points instead of full answers) and ss(syllabus changed)"
Repulsive-Pea3394,2,"1. i took pure history, comb ss/geog. i would say pure history is quite easy to score and pass and bell curve for O’s kinda low LOL. IDK bout the other pure humans but lets just say i wasnt scoring B’s for pure hist up until O’s. I got a B3 despite skipping 20marks LOL. pure hist n elec hist content quite similar. but in the end its abt ur passion 

2. i feel like hist is more of ur sbq techniques, and just make sure ur sbq is strong to pass, geog is content and understanding. cant say for lit tho

3. triple sci is rlly useless ngl LOL, L1R5 is usually english, em, am and double sci + comb humans and for L1R4 its L1R2B2 so english, r2(usually math + sci) and ur best 2 so idt you will ever need 3 sci unless ur B2 is ur third sci but even so idt u will need it

4. i took combined sci n my school didnt offer triple but all i can say is the time you devote to ur third sci can be used on the 2 sci instead

5. dont take lit so idk

6. easy or not rlly depends, but its not abt memorising dates and ppl anymore, you must rlly know ur events n the timeline and how you link it to the qn

7. go with preference, dont listen to wtv department bad bs LOL. you can always watch youtube to improve

9. personally for me, my results dropped 

10. i only started studying after prelims ( late ik ) came out with L1R4 nett 15 L1R5 nett 18 i wouldnt say i did terrible but couldve been better"
RandomDude_-,2,"I may not be qualified to answer some of your questions but I'll try my best(I took double sci and elec geog)

2. Geography has a lot of memorisation for elective and around twice for pure. If you memorise last minute for geog it will be hard to do well 

3 and 4. If you're good for science and have an interest in the sciences then I would say you can try triple sci. It is compulsory to include tla humanities in l1r5 but if you can still include all 3 sciences into your 1lr5 if you did well. Double science is less work though.
 Double science might require you to take up a pure humanities(depends I took double and no pure humanities). I think i covered this point

7. Take the subject you have an interest in. Tuition is a possible way to do well although it may cost you some money. If you enjoy physics then take it.

9. Of course there will be a jump. Your grades may not be that consistent and you may fail once in a while it's normal. However you should try to avoid failing as much as possible especially in sec 4. 

10.Review your notes once every few days(try to take down your own notes if possible). Do assessment books I think topical should be good. Don't burn out. Enjoy your holidays but also study. Don't need to study all the time but it is necessary to study once every while. Don't spend too much time spamming questions for sciences and just make sure you understand the concepts. 

For sec 2 I would really say do your best and understand your math and science as sec 3 science is partially an extension of lower secondary science. I'm not really sure how to help for humanities as I forgot how lower sec humanities was 😂

All the best"
freshcolgate1,2,"I may not be very qualified to reccomend you on much from my one sole term of experience in Upper Sec (Sec3 moment), but here is my take on this:  


1) Does somewhat depend on the person and skills. Lit is more focussed on language, Hist is SBQ and idk much about geog. It does depend on what you are good at. But in the end, Upper Sec stuff is a different mutant in terms of expectations so none of them are easy to score... (For pure lit WA1, the top scorer was B3, while the rest got C6-B4 range; And for Elec Hist/SS SBQ, which is essentially the same lah, we are told to consider the author's purpose as well, and its marked way more strictly than lower sec.) If its useful for you to know, failing geog/hist is more probable than failing Lit. The expectations to pass Lit is just not misreading and rather shallow analysis, however the expectations for SCORING is very high.  Ultimately, I would urge you to consider what you **ENJOY** when considering the humanities of choice. No point studying so hard to get an A1 when you despise the subject. What will that A1 be for when you don't really plan on pursuing it as a career anyway? And also; everything is doom and torment in the higher levels - so make your suffering sweet at the minimum!!!

But in my opinion; I'd say out of the two humans I take (Lit/Hist), Hist is easier to score as for SQ, you can memorise, and SBQ is more shallow than the horrors of pure literature... Pure Lit requires you to write paragraphs upon paragraphs of well thought-out analysis if you even want to dream of an A1. And when I say well thought-out, I truly mean it.  


2) Either Hist/Geog. No opinion on either is more content heavy as I don't take Geog. FYI, all combined humans will have half of the content of its pure counterpart. So Pure Hist has 4 units while combined has 2, Pure Lit has 2 texts (Drama/Prose) while Elec Lit has 1 prose only. I'm taking your concern to be memory, and my sole comment for this will be choose your poison and what you wish to memorise. Sure, Lit has way less to memorise, but do you prefer memorising quotes or facts? What type of facts exactly: historical or geographical? 

&#x200B;

3) ""**DON'T TAKE XXX**"" are all just ways people express their own hatred to a subject. It is a mere opinion. The common argument agaisnt triple science is that you only have 1 subject for R2 (Humans), which makes it dangerous for O-Levels (but who cares, if you love science, you put in 110% of your mind and effort to get that A1 for humans so you get to take trip scis). BUT: You do have 5 subjects for math/sciences, and more options at JC (Pure Sciences are a prerequisite to continue with H2 Sciences in JC: So you would need pure physics to do H2 physics; with occasional exceptions of course, but its always better to consider). I have friends taking triple science that love it and some that hate it. Its two years of your studying career we are discussing, and the O-Level subject you pick is what you will grind and mug up at Sec4, so its best to pick something you like to make it any less of a chore. If you have no clue or direction on what sciences to choose: triple science is an option, definitely, but  consider that: Physics is Math-based while Biology is mainly a continuation from lower sec sci (from what I seen from my bio friends atleast, its really just going more in depth and throwing many more bio facts at you...). 

4)  
Advantages of Double Science: 

* You get to pick another pure humans or another subject to learn
* You don't have science every single day for two hours - a perfect balance between the arts & sciences (could be a con if you <3 sci, but for me, please no more science)
* L1R5 academically.

Disadvantages of Double Science

* Limiting JC choices, cannot pick either H2 Bio/Phy

FYI the workload of double and trip sci is the same :(

5) OLevel lit is NOT open book, must memorise quotes! This is O-Levels so nothing is easy!!! But the key part about lit is really the analysis & essay writing, memorising quotes is the easy part, so don't let the memorisation dissuade you from the beautiful subject (biased).

6) History SQ is ok lah, just memorise and write in a PEEL (please lah even P6 can do that, its just the content to memorise is a 📈📈📈); History SBQ is either 💀💀💀 or🥳🥳🥳 depending on the person - but you can't hide from SBQ, because our best friend social studies has also inherited it from the SEAB gods (it runs in the humanities family...). That is the reason why Hist+SS is popular btw, its because Hist and SS are a cute couple, so may as well marry them into one subject to study. Once you master SS, you master most of Hist. The differences between the husband and wife is far and few between. 

7) my school physics department is questionable yet i still understand the content and love the subj. Worst come worst, SLS can become your new best friend, and the Indian guy on youtube is definitely pleased to teach you F=ma. I can't really comment on Bio because i don't take it.  


8) - 

9) Backgrd info - I was good at Math/Sc, and above average in Lit.  
Sec3 Sciences and Math were not the murderers and hitmen out to get me. In fact, my Math and Sciences were all As.  
It was the languages and their distant cousin Literature: Those Bs and Cs haunt me til this day. So ya, the change is rather drastic especially in English Language. You'd be surprised at the amount of single digit grades there were for English out of everything.

10) the road to olevels is gradual and you prepare the moment you step into your first class of sec3. anything could come out of that papers. in fact, emath papers test the things from sec1 chp1 of emath.

SO MY ADVICE? Run the marathon instead of sprinting it; Because when you sprint one day before the dreaded paper, then you're miles off the finish line  


*\[Tips for Sec2?\]* Please start fighting the war for your subject combi of choice. The subjects you plan to continue on, do put 100% effort in them. Those you dont? Then an A1 will do. Hold high expectations for your foundation in Sec2! **EVERYTHING IN SEC3 IS BASED OFF LOWER SEC CONTENT**!! Amath is NOT HARD AT ALL if you 150% understand your Emath; Sciences will be a breeze if you really digest the information in Lower Sec.  


AND NEVER, EVER MEMORISE MATH! It's very horrific and memorising the subject will not go well for you in upper sec at all (esp amath). Yes, somehow someone i know has memorised math. They are suffocating in the walls in Add math."
Just-Present2923,2,"3. I never got more than 20 for elective lit and ss but took triple science cuz I am v.passionate about sciences. Somehow got A2 in O lvls but I mugged the entire ss textbook and also consulted my humanities teachers alot. You should study the subjects interest you. Bio and chem are content heavy while phy is more on knowing your formulas well.
Some courses in local uni look for o lvl phy."
Dramatic_Rest7487,1,3) you cant get into science stream (jc route if thats the one u are gunning for) if you don't take pure sciences.  Definitely not with combined sciences.
sectumsempiak,1,"1. tbh all pure humanities have their own difficulties and i won’t say that there would be one that is the easiest to score. i took pure geog so it was a lot of memory work & that was one of the reasons why geog was kind of tough 🫡 

2. i think all are heavy in their content. maybe lit? cause theirs is more of analysis but geog and hist is more of memorisation work 

3. it’s rly up to you if you can’t decide between physics and bio LMAO but just know that it’s going to be tougher because you have three pure sciences. you’ll most likely take combined humans if you take triple and honestly it’s doable in o levels. just choose the subj based on passion because it will be an advantage in upper sec. you wouldn’t want to be stuck studying a subj you hate for 2 years righttttt 

4. didn’t take double sciences so can’t say much 

5. lit is never open book. the format is similar to lower sec, sect a has one passage based question while the others are just basically the question itself. section b is poetry, choose 1 out of the 2 questions given. i took elect lit so i’m not sure about the drama paper for pure lit

6. didn’t take hist so can’t say anyth 😵

7. even if your physics department is bad, it doesn’t mean you can’t self study on your own. you can also rely on external sources such as tuition if you’re comfortable with that :) 

8. didn’t take hcl so i cannot say anything also LOL

9. wouldn’t say super drastic… but you can feel that sec 3 is more intense??? was shocked by the amt of homework piled & how last min studying doesn’t work anym because your subjs are more content heavy 😅😅

10. i studied consistently since jan and i think it’s super effective because i didn’t worry a lot when it was nearer to o levels because i had already put in consistent effort in knowing my work. managed to hit my expectations so i was rly satisfied & happy!!! 

pls treasure your time in lower sec. you will no longer feel as relaxed as you are now compared to upper sec 🥲🥲 u shld still continue to study but just don’t find yourself mugging 24/7 for lower sec. save that energy for upper sec esp sec 4 LMAOOOO all the best 💪"

Your #1 job now is to get ahead of it. Standard PR book. You tell everyone and anyone that listens your side of the story. Hell, you can even push out a statement in class chat. The point is to at least get them your side of the story before the prevailing narrative takes over.

If you don't say anything, people will assume the first narrative is true and you are hiding in shame.

Hence the comedian Louis Clark joking that women have to know how to reject a man without getting killed. Or all the stories in the press of men punching women who reject them.

kokoggz,2,"asr j1 here. i think that one thing that separates asr from most of the other JCs is that it will be shifting to its upper serangoon campus next year, which may possibly be more convenient for you such that you'd prefer asr over other schools. another thing about asr is that it is one of the two schools that offer tlep (the other being njc), but not sure if this would be relevant for you. and yes, as you should know, asr is one of the schools that offers H2 computing as well as H2 further mathematics and H2 art. perhaps you could say that the wide range of subjects available in asr interests you since you have yet to find your passion and want to keep your doors open and the other schools may not offer these subjects. these are the more solid and factual reasons that you can say during the interview since they do not involve any opinions or bias. if you want more reasons (i may have missed out some points) perhaps you could also find asr's page in the JAE booklet. that should tell you everything you need to know. as for H2 computing, you do not need to have O-level computing to take up the subject. there will be a selection test though, and merely from rumours, the test will only be like a logic/IQ test which includes some puzzles to solve. i dont think it includes anything about coding or programming. i have a friend in tjc who has ZERO computing experience and he told me the test there was just an easy IQ test."
slxy_sarahh,1,Hi!! New J1 here and I'm actually taking computing (with zero previous experience) and so far its been okay. You don't need to take comp in sec sch but they'll make you take a proficiency test to get in. I was worried abt it but it was actually q easy like rlly basic common sense questions and like flow chart stuff to see if you would understand. The classes really start from 0 and at a basic level to accomodate people who don't have experience so I wouldn't be too worried :) (one of my friends took the proficiency test and got like half of it wrong but he still passed the proficiency test)

Zelmier,4,"The unimportant part isn't really unimportant leh. Since you're asking in the context of applied chemistry, I'll just assume you are referring to science degrees.

Yes, degree matters for STEM jobs. It affects the rank and pay that you're gonna get vs a diploma. Generally diploma pay caps out around 2.4k ish for science, might be higher, but rarely breaks 3k or reaches 3k even. This is considering the general max rank (usually senior analyst/technician). Degree holder pay can go far higher as they can break into management ranks. Starting pay minimally 2.5k, average ish 3.3k-3.4k. Degree holders start off straightaway as scientists (chemists/microbiologists rather than the research fellow sense), unless the organisation has a flat hierarchy where everyone in the lab is an analyst (but there will still be pay difference).

Priority is dependent on company's needs. If they want to go budget, or if they only need staff to do routine work, they will get diploma holders. If they need more thinkers to start new projects or develop the business, they will get more degree holders.

Lmk if you have further questions on the career portion."

cy9nide,1,"laptops can be found on the school's website at a later date. 

$250-300 should be enough, but if you're constantly going out to have fun and spending more than you need, then keep it safe to $400-$500?

school trips you have to apply for, and you'll go through a process (checking of gpa, conduct, etc). notes are not needed unless you kiasu and want to read up more, but usually lecture notes are more than enough + library materials if needed. school shirts are only if you want to buy, or let's say camps organised by your school (students union/business school) are probably $10 or less.

Usual_Imagination194,1,"I think I can add a little besides what's commented already.

1) I'm also not too great with tech things, but I suggest Windows for biz. I'm in biz and I've seen a number of my peers with macs struggling with some applications we use. But macs are so cool... Many of my peers prefer a lighter laptop so they get a 13""/14"" laptop but I got a 15"" one because I need a bigger screen haha, depends on your needs. Don't go for a gaming laptop unless you have money to spare.

2) Honestly it wouldn't be quite different from now/sec 4. Eating in school often and going to restaurants with your friends after lessons. But that varies depending on how you want your social life to be. School food should be around hawker centre's prices, if not cheaper (generally). Transport will be same as sec school, you'll get your concession card when you enter poly.

3) I had to buy a textbook but you can always try to borrow from the library. Poly lecture slides are actually good enough that I rarely flipped the book, so you can choose not to buy it too. I think something that I didn't know I needed to buy was biz formal attire for presentations. You are literally graded on that so do save some money for that."

At the end of the day SG's A-level and the Western equivalent examination has the same value, SG students however jumped through more hoops for the same result. (paraphrased) 

I don't know why Asia, or specifically SG has some superiority complex towards standardised examinations. Even IB, which has better international recognition, is considered easy to our A-levels. At least MOE is actually doing something with the recent announcements especially to eliminate PW from RP calculations which should have been done 19 years ago."

lauises,26,"I wish more people would be aware of this. The downside for many Singaporeans is thinking that the world works the same way Singapore works. 

I think another takeaway here is that we shouldn't feel too bad for ourselves if we weren't amazing in school in Singapore. We're already doing great at a global standard even for our very average students. Our average ""Normal"" stream capabilities are actually above average globally speaking. We need to stop feeling bad for ourselves.

If you really feel things are unfair, it's possible to take non-singapore exams like SATs etc instead. Should be very doable. 

Long story for the simplified background of Singapore's competitive nature below.

\---

We're a weird country that honestly shouldn't have existed. No natural resources is a HUGE deal, coupled with a stupidly small space that doesn't even allow a rudimentary agricultural economy. Note that almost every civilisation out there in infancy could rely on agriculture or hunting as a foundation. Almost by necessity, Singapore could only form in the midst of globalisation. 

One path/fate of our country would have been to be a ""labor farm""/sweatshop type economy, where things just come here to be processed and shipped out. But even that is not feasible because of how small we are. Even if we pulled that off, we'll be a country with no power at the global level.

So the painful path we took was to ""be the best"". Smarter, more hardworking etc. So standards are raised to a stupid high degree. We need to show that even our average people are very very good. Unfortunately, it's a very painful path. Because this was also coupled with the planted mindset that... We're never good enough.

But we're also at a point now where we are reevaluating this given a new era."
ForeignLifeguard5266,29,"There are many comments about US students having to beef up their portfolio, by attending extra curricular, taking additional classes etc, making it as if the effort they put in and the stress they handle is equivalent to ours. As if Singaporean students do not do that, we do that on top of our demanding academics, and more. Do you really think if our academics are as easy as theirs, that we won't be putting in even greater effort than them in beefing up our portfolio?   


You can even see posts like US law students stating they study for 5-6 hour in a day and the comments are all ""wow damn how do you do that? I could never"", when we literally do that daily before we even attend university. Excluding ivy league level universities, they are all a joke where students just attend university to party and find themselves.  


Stop trying to defend US students on their behalf, they literally don't give a damn about us. If you ask them whether they think Singaporean education or US education is harder, you can bet they will be claiming their own. Stop dick riding for foreigners who wouldn't even bat an eye for Singapore, at least be proud of our own education system and universities."
Lao_gong,7, the truth - ask any working adult - is that white superiority is rife in the working world. there are also studies which show this. a white bugger eg a consultant etc opens his mouth and the works listens. an asian does so and no one listens.  and then u hv practices of MNCs- asian offices work far harder than white ones ( i mean geographical location) . welcome to the world of colonial legacies. so yes as in everything else being Asian means we hv to wok far harder to prove our worth in education too
Relief-Old,4,"The American education system is vastly inferior (imo) compared to sg A level/IB. The SAT math section is a joke, students in my class that got a 4/5 in HL math got 750++ on SAT.

hometeambuibui,2,lol this guy have no idea how US admissions work
qu1ck_ps,1,"the problem is to get into prestigious US schools you need a near perfect SAT and tons of extracurriculars. The sat and act arent difficult because of the questions, the difficulty is in the accuracy and timing. Its 3-4 hours straight of 1 minute or less per question, and you can only really afford to get maybe 5 questions in total wrong if you want a 1550 or better. Like another comment here, this isnt the entrance exam, its the one to filter out the top 1% to filter them out further. The kids that go to the top schools are also having at least 2-3 extracurriculars that they are probably competing or performing at a state if not national level at."
tby298,1,"The SAT forms only a minor part of academics (~10%) in US college admission. More important are high school grades (all 4 years) and the APs, which while much easier in testing format than Singapore A levels, run for only a year and cover the same level of content (e.g. AP Chem and A level Chem are quite similar, but AP Calculus is divided into AB and BC, two courses, and actually covers more advanced content than As)

SATs are known to be poor predictors of US college performance. High school grades and APs predict much better. Unlike in Singapore, there is no national standardised “one size fits all” assessment. Academics is only ~30% of the admissions criteria, and it matters less and less the higher up you apply to. After all, the normal distribution is much higher up (70-80%) than what we’re used to in Singapore, it doesn’t differentiate much."
The_Wobbly_Guy,1,"The american system is riddled with inconsistencies because of conflicting interests.

They can't have too rigorous stds for SATs - the disparate impact is too obvious and the asian-white-black gaps too significant, and hard to justify against more 'holistic' systems. Better to set the benchmark relatively low, then use other factors to try to equalise.

That's why extracurriculars are so important, along with race, because they're a lot easier to fudge. And of course, Harvard and likely many elite universities use subjective personality scores to ensure they don't enroll too many asians.

Hell, Columbia just announced they are going test-optional on admissions.

I'm glad we're not affected by the race card here even if it is pretty obvious there is also observable disparate impact, particularly for elite courses such as pharmacy, law, and medicine."
downvoteifsmalldick,1,"US students are expected to take a few APs, some of which are harder than SG curriculum (Calculus BC, Physics C etc.) while others are piss easy (Chemistry). Also US students tend to have a MUCH better portfolio than SG students, like being a national athlete, winning multiple national and international competitions, multiple leadership positions and literally creating their own little business whilst getting literal perfect grades and GPA, and 5s for AP exams ALL AT THE SAME TIME (I’m talking about the students are in top universities like Ivy League)."
ohwhoopsmybad,8,"1. Last year for those that applied with 80rp, most, if not all, were able to get in without ABA. To my knowledge, 78.75 and below needed to ABA to get into CHS. However, the cut off point has been steadily increasing so there is a chance that 80rp ppl may now need to ABA. 

2. I would highly recommend putting a personal statement in your application (ABA) even if you’re above the “safe grade” unless you are 100% confident that you will get in because you won’t know if the cut off point will shoot up (as the cut off point seems to be on a steady increase).  If your rp is above the cut off point, they will not even look at your ABA I believe. ABA is only applicable if you do not hit the cut off point so you do not have to worry about doing poorly in ABA affecting your application should u have high rp. 

3. No difference. When you enter CHS, you get to choose what major you want afterwards anyway (regardless of if you ABA-ed or not). The cut off point is the same for all non-restricted majors in CHS. Only difference (I assume) would be when you ABA and need to answer why this major specifically in the questions and/or go through interviews for said major and thus potentially be interviewed by Prof teaching that major. 

4. There will be generic questions (e.g. What careers will you be thinking of pursuing with this major) but there will also be questions related to the course. E.g. they’ll ask you to explain how you might conduct a hypotest if you apply for DSA. (granted, the course related questions will likely be related to the qns in the subsequent ABA essay qns where they ask you about what topic are you interested in that relates to the major)

5. It depends. Some people only do writing test, some people only do interview, some people need to do both. (I’m assuming this refers to the timed essay part rather than the 3 qns that you need to answer before the writing test and interviews even begin)

6. I mean you can write in the description what the others mean haha. I don’t think they’ll be that nitpicky about this particular aspect as long as your achievement is there.

but like i said read up about the course detail even tho yk what you wanna go like there should be a section where they talk abt pfp year coverage

I thought it was just me bc i was the lousy one but all my friends said so and they were getting worried cuz they using for emb3. Anyways another fast forward to n level result day and surprisingly i got a grade 5 like i thought i would fail 💀 most of my friend ended up getting a grade 3 which was a downgrade from their mye/prelim and they didn’t even end up using it for their emb3….so amath is really a waste of time like i wasted money on it too bc i had tuition LOL anyways some background info i scored raw 8 and am gg to pfp soon! I could’ve said i got ALL distinctions but i can’t bc i have amath lol…. 

Okay but that’s just my experience 😭😭 amath is actually really useful in the future so i advice you to continue studying it but not put in TOO much effort if you’re not good at it yk? Because 1 year ago i was working my butt off trying to at least score a grade 4 and maybe finally scoring well for my n levels but ended up wasting my time and SLEEP omg i regretted not using the time to focus on my other subjects like science

Also this is super childish for 16-17 y/os to have this sort of cluster mentality what 😭"
dejavuinmalibu,2,its really normal jc has a lot of this type of things even my class in jc. just dont mind them and hangout with your own friends who you can clique with. jc rlly has no time for all this beef just distance yourself from them and try not to get affected/involved with them

HeroAddam,1,"Over time I believe all these politics won’t matter much as you all will be busy studying for A levels. As a poly Y2 student going to Y3, all I have to say is that it’s always important to watch your back and not be too trusting and vulnerable to people. My class isn’t very homely and welcoming and because of peer evaluation and peer appraisal for almost every module we take, the very people u joke and trust your problems with can be the same people that sabotage your ratings and affect your grades directly, which will indirectly affect your future as grades affect our GPA… 

JC is only 2 years from what I know so no point getting involved in all these class politics, at the end of the day, they will say it’s every man for themselves because of the bell curve and competition, hence it’s best to focus on your growth and development"
Eurito1,3,"Actually, you can apply to PT SUSS and you have a high chance of getting in. It's a better choice than SIMGE."
bloom4eva,2,"So for SIM, your GPA is fine don’t worry. the issue now is when is your ORD date/month because for RMIT they have two intakes, one in January and another in June/July. But honestly, let’s say you miss the 2024 june intake, the time between january intake isn’t that far, in the mean time you can work and since you have a accounting diploma im sure you can get relevant experience before school starts. 

There’s another school you can consider as well and it’s UOL Accounting & Finance. actually some poly students benefit better in UOL (different curriculum structure than poly), i also notice the UOL accounting cohort is relatively larger too. But again, this boils down to what curriculum style fits you: if you really benefit from group projects then RMIT is suitable. but if you want more self-learning, quantitative modules then UOL is suitable. also i heard RMIT is temporarily removing exams… maybe you wanna consider that too 

like the others had said, try SUSS PT degree too! you may need some work experience before to meet their admission criteria. but it save you a lot of cost of going to a private/distance-learning uni and plus you can work in the mean time and gain alot of work experience!"

For the latter, everyone may end up with a larger workload anyway. For the former, learn group effectiveness techniques and have everybody understand and agree on the rules of engagement. If everyone wants to score A for their PW, you will get off to a good start."
wheezingsoo,12,"hi! i was a pw leader and this is my opinion ^^ 

pros: 
- you can lead the group and take charge of how you work with the members since most of the time they just wait for you to give instructions so the group doesn’t turn into a mess. in some cases slacker leaders are picked out and that just brings bad news 
- looks good for your portfolio ig if you have nothing much (like me) atm and possibly uni application/interviews (if they ask for any leadership experience) 

cons:
- if the group doesn’t do well halfway it might be hard to bounce back. either that, or some people start pointing fingers at you the leader (i’ve seen it happen and it did not end well.. one group had to change leader twice) 
- if you don’t know how to properly distribute tasks and responsibilities well, it becomes a one man show. which often leads to group downfall 

adding on! if you think it’s going to be all you leading the group into getting an A think again!!! there was one group in my class and their group leader had a total ‘just let me do it and we confirm will get A so you guys don’t have to screw up’ kind of attitude. what happened? at OP practice he complained everyone didn’t do their job and started shouting at one group mate for not doing shit. as a group leader, it is your responsibility that everyone does their role well so the group can properly progress. at times, you will be criticised, but that’s okay it’s all part of the learning process imo. but if you don’t think you have the mental/emotional capacity to do that, then i’d suggest stepping back a bit and see if there’s someone else who is capable 😊 all the best op!"

I had to take up the duty he refuse to do and at the same time feel as if im intruding cuz im not the leader. If u r responsible and motivated, take up the position and all of u will have a easier time"
ytolololol,4,"Lol no. I had a pw grp leader who did flat out 0. I guess he was a master in the art of bullshitting but he did nth else. Coordination, report, presentation slides, etc, in the end he did basically 0. But i guess his art of bullshitting saved him his A during OP. He didnt get any stellar report on pw grp leader etc anyway. (And the cher was biased TOWARDS (not against him and there wasnt any ""exceptional"" value added in the end.)

My point is; pw grp leader literally doesnt matter. U can choose to be an incompetent asshole and u are still the grp leader. U can choose to be competent grp leader and it still doesnt value add anyth other than making ur members life easier. U can choose to not be leader and still end up doing leader job anyway. It depends on what you want to gain out of PW. If all u want is just the A, then ya just cut urself some slack and not be a leader. If your goal is to grow leadership opportunities etc, u can try i guess...? Truth be told i dont think u will gain or grow much unless ur grpmates are real fked (literally; the best growing experiences are when u are thrown shit u cant handle and u are forced to grow to handle it.). Its up to u honestly. If i were u, i will cut myself some slack and just dont be leader. Cuz simply put; if ur mates joker, u end up doing the most anyway. If ur mates useful, u can watch how your leader handles the work and learn accordingly. If u be leader; (assuming u give a shit) u take extra responsibility and 0 value added to portfolio. If u be leader (and dont give a shit), u just make everyones lives harder."

chimmyyeah,2,"ex-GL here

as a lot of the other comments have mentioned, being the leader is not easy since it comes with a lot of responsibilities & can get very stressful. to let you know what are the main roles of a GL...

&#x200B;

* disseminating info

the teachers will have a grp chat with only the GLs to disseminate info(i think this was what they meant by ""priority"" since GLs know abt everything first) and it'll be your role to forward all that to your members and work on it. sometimes there'll be indiv work, sometimes there'll be grp work, sometimes the teachers may send a last min text, sometimes you get notified of a impromptu presentation/deadline. as a GL, it's your job to ensure that what needs to be done is done. 

&#x200B;

* meet-ups/discussions 

you'll have to arrange a common time for everyone in the grp to come tgt and work on an assignment/proposal/presentation. it'll be difficult to arrange such meet-ups/zooms as ppl have other commitments. not only that, when it comes to pw, forget abt gauging how long it wld take to complete smth because you'll run into roadblocks quite frequently(there were various occasions my grp had to stay up till v late to figure out things T-T). so a 2hr long zoom may turn into a 4hr long one....

oh and you'll also be the person reaching out to your teacher(s) to arrange consultations or to ask qns.

&#x200B;

* DEADLINES!!

i think this is the most impt job of a GL: to make sure your grp's on track w all the deadlines set because believe me, you wouldn't want to rushing to complete a core aspect of your WR nearing the deadline. sometimes, you'll have to the 'bad guy' and rush your grp to complete stuff that's not immediately due in consideration of upcoming tests, etc. basically, you have to pace your grp accordingly. keep in mind, grp members may not always be understanding. 

&#x200B;

i would say try to gauge what type of people your grp members are first. usually you would have gone through a few lessons in your groups before the teacher asks yall to choose the leader. so, use that opportunity to see if there seems to be anyone who has the 'leader vibe' or basically someone who actually pays attention + stays on-task. if there's seems to be no such person, it'll be better to just volunteer to be the leader.

i know i just mentioned a lot of cons of being a leader but it's better to take up the stress & responsibilities than be lead by someone who doesn't care. as a member, you'll have limited autonomy(since you don't directly get all of the relevant info + you don't really have the authority to plan out when/what/how things get done)and you need a competent leader to get you through pw. trust me, i know of grps with 'slacker-leader's and things did not go well to say the least.."
math_dydx,1,"Nobody will care anything about PW after your last batch of graded PW is over by end of the year. So no benefits at all for anything related to PW, like being PW group leader or what PW subject rep.

tby298,38,"If I remember correctly, only around 30% of each cohort takes A levels. Given that you scored 9 points, it’s normal to move from a secondary school where you were one of the top students and a JC where you’re a normal student. Don’t feel pressured to study as hard as some people in your class, but do keep up with lectures, because once you fall behind it’s really intimidating to catch up, especially when tutorials leave you behind too. 

But in J1, it’s ok to maintain a normal work-life balance even if your grades aren’t that good. Just try not to fail any subjects. Good luck! And don’t play COD for more than 1/2 hours a day. If the empty time is too hard to fill with studying, you can volunteer or join school events. It’s not just about time management, it’s about energy management too. I doubt most people can spend the whole day just to study, eat and sleep. If you do things that give you energy, you can use that energy to study more productively.

Kkoh007,1,"Been there, done that.

Was playing COD during my JC time too. I remembered playing so much that I got sick of prestige at 1 point and then just grinding thousands of hours to unlock gold for all guns. Those were the days. 

What I can say is: 

You may not stop playing immediately but start finding other fun things to do, even if it means other video games at the start. Playing COD for 7 hours a day is not healthy for one's mental state. You have to start spreading the hours out. Call a friend up, hang out, play a sport. It's all about balance.

I assume you are in your 1st year. Right now, you might look at your peers daily and feel that you are lagging far behind. What I will say is this feeling that you have ""lost"" all those time will not matter in future. We will all reach a point in time when we will stop feeling ""guilty"" for every small task that we have missed out. There is only this much one person can do. 

Instead, what is required now is to look at the big picture. Start by spending just 2 hours a day studying your content subjects. The remaining time can be used to do fun stuff and develop in other areas you are interested in. If 2 hours is too much for now, try 1 hour first. If 2 hours is too little during critical periods (eg. promos), try 3 hours. It's not about the number of hours, it's about studying smart. 

You may say, ""how can I be sure if 1 to 2 hours is enough when my peers seem like they are studying so hard daily"". Well it's not about them now, it's about you making small and consistent steps daily. Maybe it's has been some time since you got into the routine but you have to believe that things will work out. A Levels is just another milestone. I don't know about others but I felt that in Uni, the amount of content that we cover in each half year was similar to the 2 years in A Levels. There is still a long way to go. Start now."

and on ur pt of being behind sch schedule i think its very normal cos seriously the time u take to do it vs the time the cher takes to go thru is like 4:1 ratio. so what i suggest is keeping up with wtv they are going thru now then spend arnd 30mins each day(if u can) to catch up on wtv u missed out (p sure u havent missed out that much) (plus pt is march hols coming up so u have time to catch up b4 t2 starts)

Staring off for even 10 seconds already eliminates any chance of a high band 2 scoring.

There isn’t a said time limit for you to think but ideally less than 30s to sort out your thoughts, because anything longer than that causes awkward silence and staring.

>can u just stone there for like 5 mins thinking up points?

Short answer, yes but no, don’t do that.

Long answer, the examiners would probably think you don’t know how to answer if you stone for 5 mins and would start prompting you. If you stone for 5 mins again even after the prompt, your marks would probably get affected."

But the mainn point would be to have a normal convo with them. So just try to say something at the start and slowly start expanding on your point or elaborating another one later.

histgod,8,"hello! im a ppe freshie so i guess i can answer a bit of the first qn! for the more technical bits, here's a link to the facebook live that students + profs under ppe did for open house, which might prove most helpful.

the curriculum is split evenly among philo, polsci and econs - in the past, ppe students could 'specialise' in either p, p, or e, but now we gotta pay equal attention to each one equally! i can only speak for the intro mods, but imo econs is the most 'rigorous' given the amount of math you gotta do, and the fact that the intro mod for econs = entire h2 econs syllabus and some banking stuff being crammed into 12 weeks. the intros for philo and polsci are also quite demanding, given the volume of readings you have to do. however, i do think that the balance between the math-y econs and the readings for philo + polsci is quite nice!

career options: we only have one batch of graduates (ppe is quite a new major), but they've found jobs in many diff industries, such as banking and finance, buisness analysis, journalism, politics, public service, social work and research.

i think what kinda makes or breaks your ppe entry are not just your academics and portfolio, but there's also a separate ppe application you have to do in a diff portal - you have to write an essay based on the principles of philo/polsci/econs and record a short video of yourself! so yeah i'd say 86rp is fine but you gotta do well for the indiv ppe application too.

jiayous for apps! and congrats on pop-ing!"

BaeJHyun,14,Marine bio? Don’t stay in sg
ThrowRA-Confuzzled,6,"Yes, it’s absolutely safe to do so. If you’re interested in Life Sciences at NUS, you can do bridging courses for biology and chemistry during your first year since you’re coming from a different background, so that’s no problem at all.

Marine biology is super, super interesting and it’s such a broad field! It is true that Australia is excellent for it, as is the US (Duke, Syracuse and UOregon have really good programmes).

It honestly depends on which part of marine biology you’re interested in. Singapore’s marine biology sector isn’t non-existent, it’s actually pretty good. We have one research institute on St. John’s island that is run in collaboration with NUS (and NParks?), and I believe there’s gonna be another one built at NUS in the future too. 

In SG, marine biology will be focused on tropical environments, corals and mangroves. Unfortunately, not many charismatic animals like whales, dolphins and big sharks - you’ll have to go to the US or Australia for those.

Also, there’s a slight difference between Life Sciences vs Environmental Studies at NUS. I think the latter focuses more on conservation, while the former is more scientific and lab-based (but allows you to hop over to other fields should marine biology not interest you anymore). But there’s definitely a lot of overlap, so you’ll have to check online!"

shadowscyll,5,"Here's what I jotted down after taking the ESIS selection test in 2021 (unfortunately it's incomplete). Hopefully it's still useful to you (I believe the format should be largely unchanged).



The paper is MCQ-based (5 choices per MCQ) and consists of 9 sections, which can be broadly categorized into vocabulary, arithmetic and pattern recognition. Each section is timed, i.e. you can only do questions for a given section during the time period, and questions are arranged in order of increasing difficulty. Answers are shaded on an OAS (Note: You shouldn’t fill the entire bubble — a strike is explicitly recommended.).

When not stated, the time given for each section is 10 minutes and the number of MCQs in each section is 20. In total, the test should take around 2 hours to complete. 

The following is a list of sections in chronological order:

**Vocabulary**
 
General notes: The vocabulary tested isn’t very complicated (for the most part), — if you’re an avid reader, it shouldn’t trouble you. 


1. Verbal classification

Task: Given a list of three words, find a similarity/theme between the three words and hence choose the word that best fits into the list.

E.g. Glue, Tape, Paperclip

Choices: Stickers, Scissors, Stapler, Pencil, Penknife 
Answer: Stapler (all tools to join pieces of paper)

Note: Many questions include the similarity along with the actual answer.  Below is an obvious illustration of this, but it will be much more subtle in the actual paper. Remember to scrutinise your answers carefully.

E.g. Green, Red, Blue

Choices: Colour, Brown, etc., etc.
Answer: Brown (all are colours)


2. Sentence completion 

Task: Given a sentence with a missing word, choose the most appropriate word.

E.g. The thought of an impending examination _____ Jonathan’s spirits. 

Choices: Raised, Lifted, Injured, Oppressed, etc. 
Answer: Oppressed

3. Verbal analogies

Task: Given a pair of related words and another unpaired word, choose the word that has the same relationship to the unpaired word as the first pair. 

E.g. Tree: Forest, Person:

Choices: Family, Individual, Crowd, etc., etc. 
Answer: Crowd (many trees -> forest, many persons -> crowd)

Note: Arguably the hardest vocabulary section. In some questions, the relation is between the words of the first pair and the words of the second pair, not within the pair itself.

E.g. Wrapping: Frosting, Present:
Choices: Gift, Celebration, Cake, etc., etc.
Answer: Cake (wrap a present, frost a cake)


**Arithmetic**

General notes: Being able to do quick mental arithmetic is extremely beneficial for this section.   Make sure you nail the addition/subtraction/multiply/division of single digit numbers to a tee.

4. Qualitative relations 

_I think this section was about inequalities < > =, or ordering the numbers in some manner_

5. Number series:

Given a series of integers, deduce a pattern and hence choose the next term in the series.

E.g. 67, 35, 19, 11, 7, 
Choices: 5, 8, 16, 3, 13
Answer: 5 (The pattern is (x+3)/2)

Note: Initial questions involve simple addition/subtraction/multiplication/division. Later questions involve combinations of addition/subtraction  and multiplication/division. 

6. Equation building:

_Using a combination of numbers and operators to get an equation_

**Pattern recognition (789)**

_Raven progressive matrices, unfold a folded piece of paper with holes and predict the resultant shape_

For diagrams, a simple workaround is to use Google Doc's drawing function. It has many types of shapes and lines (including free hand), and can also insert images. After u are done drawing, u can screenshot it (use windows key + shift + s to screenshot a part of ur screen), and paste the image."

GloxyVI,24,"It's not all fun and games to be frank.

In NUS even within let's say PFM/IPM, the different calibre of students increases exponentially the higher up the honours classification you go. I've taken mods with Biz students in SMU and also Y4 law students, so I can safely say that at the upper band, most of the people there are actually quite zai across different courses. You can easily sense it after awhile as the output of work will be pretty outstanding (and their willingness to burn their life for grades).

&#x200B;

>but I do hope that more can be done to recognize graduates from the other local unis.

Only time will tell.

OYK in 2014 (iirc) already said he did not wish for anymore graduates else we end up like South Korea, which he does have a point. If it weren't for politics, he likely would have gotten his wish and SUSS/SIT would never have come to be.

It's a bellcurve everywhere you go. If only a few get degrees, then those with degrees will be favoured. If everyone has degrees, then only a few universities will be favoured. The curve will keep shifting right the more you try to move the axis. 

>Have also seen stuff such as automatic filtering of resumes if an applicant isn’t from Big 3, which I feel is quite unfair given the efforts that all graduates have put in into their course of study.

Yes it is unfair and it sucks. But again, businesses are here to make money and don't run a school. Even among the big 3 the HR fella can filter even based on universities and down to honours only. Goldman Sachs only filters people with 4.75 CAP and above iirc (2020). Lower FCH people from NUS will not stand a chance unless you have networking.

It's a case of too few good jobs and too much supply which depresses wages. It is actually one of the main policy goals if you read how SG leaders call the country a ""cost centre"". The current labour crisis is actually good for you as you can ask for higher paycheck. But the moment they turn on the foreign labour tap to depress wages again (and get more revenue because SG is struggling with budget), then the average degree holder will feel the pain."
yelloworeoo,4,"I am a SUSS alumnus myself and I took a few modules at NUS. NUS is much more competitive and the bell curve/moderation is much more punishing compared to SUSS. Although I was doing very well at SUSS, I felt like a small fish in the big ocean over at NUS.

I don't think part-time students in SUSS are competing with the big 3 solely on the merit of our degrees. We have to be cognizant of our strengths and pick our battles carefully. The PT programme is tailored for us to hold full-time jobs while studying. With the right work experience, our resumes can equal or even stand out from the rest."

ThrowRA-Confuzzled,18,"Go for it. There’s absolutely nothing wrong with reconsidering this career, especially after hearing about the reality of it. Those who are fervent in their motivation may not have considered this reality, or already have but are still set on being a doctor. Don’t let them discourage you - everyone’s path is different.

And don’t worry about the work-life balance issues - as the other commenter said, it’s 100% possible to achieve it. You’ll find workarounds when you get to that stage, just like in JC.

The starting years of medicine will definitely be tough - but can’t that be said the same for any career? Though exceptions exist, many careers require that initial bridge to cross before you reach the promised land. Depending on the specialty you wanna go into, it will eventually get better.

Also, the “lifelong studying” isn’t as daunting as it seems. Try not to think of it in terms of lecture notes and exam halls, but more of ensuring your knowledge and skills are up-to-date (ironically, there’s this paid online service called UpToDate that helps you stay afloat with current advances in medicine - many doctors use this). 

After all, medicine is advancing so much, and some specialties are seeing new technologies emerge much faster than others. Think of it like to studying current market trends as a banker. You’re just staying updated. Of course, there are those exams to obtain your membership at organisations like the Academy of Medicine (Singapore), but those aren’t that scary either, because they’re essentially testing you on what you’ve been working as over the last few years as a resident or medical officer, so you’ll be pretty familiar. Less rote memorisation and more of drawing your knowledge from your current practice."

If you have done your research and have seen what it takes for your first 6-8 years in practice, and you are prepared to tough it out, then pursue your passion in medicine. All professions require you to tough it out in the first 6-8-10 years. Even if you choose,let’s say law, you’ll have to put in the hours. Even IB, PWM or accounting or anything else really. What matters most is your interest and passion to spur you on in the tough years starting out. Also, medicine is one of the professions where you can actually do it part time in future should you need to set aside time for family etc. And doctors don’t retire till when they choose to or if they are no longer mentally able to handle the rigors of practice. This applies to all other professional positions too. So by investing in yourself with hard work now, it will stand you in good stead for your future. ATB with your decision and congratulations on your excellent results."

nigelmohh,12,"**all my life ive wanted to do medicine - i like the content, i like helping people, i like communicating with people and maintaining interpersonal relationships.**

You sure? Have spoken to many healthcare professionals. Compared to other professions, Drs do spend less time doing those cos they diagnose and look at things from a systems level. **In general**, the medical professionals that spend time on the ground (think of nurses, therapists) are those that communicate and talk to people all the time and accompany them on their journey. 

If you're keen in healthcare, consider other professions like allied health. But with 90RP, you can consider the overseas ones."

PlasticTourist3025,4," I would say just go for it!! It seems like you're genuinely passionate about medicine and not just in it for the prestige.   Ofc being a doctor comes with a lot of hard work and trials, but so do many other professions.

Since you like helping people, maybe consider social work/allied health/psychology as well!! you can also consider specialised health (as a career) eg dermatology, gynecology, optometry. dentistry and pharmacy seem like viable options too!! Healthcare is very expansive and not just limited to surgeons/GPs/working in those big hospitals.  Congrats on 90rp and ATB!!"
owupjrdr,4,"hello. MO here not in residency (yet), also wondering what to do with my life rn. i'm tired and this may not be as coherent as it could be but hope it's helpful. (also might have some overlap with what other ppl have already said, sry)

1. “i like communicating with people and maintaining interpersonal relationships”   
i thought this too before i started medicine, but i’m starting to realise it’s not that simple. i want to differentiate between interacting with patients and interacting with other doctors/other healthcare workers.  
patients:  
\- it gets tiring. the volume depends on the setting. in A&E/pri care it’s non-stop and ultimately ur talking to a new stranger every few minutes. it’s socially exhausting unless you’re a strong extrovert. also with high volume, it’s frustrating when patients ramble or can’t give clear answers and internally i’m like sry but can u just answer my questions concisely… and i hate myself for being so impatient bc if i had more TIME i’d love to chat  
\- (surgeons talk a bit less. anaesthetists even less. radiologists/pathologists/microbiologists none at all. so there are options, if you tire of talking to patients later on)  
\- it’s not tiring just bc social energy, but also bc many patients don’t listen to u LOL. if ur the type to care a lot and get quite invested it can be v frustrating. but this is smth people can learn to manage with experience and maturity  
\- that being said, generally enjoying communication and interpersonal relationships (and being GOOD at it) is not unfavourable for medicine. or rather, if one is bad at it then maybe one /shouldn’t/  
colleagues:  
\- i came to realise i like interacting with colleagues more, having a team to hang out with, at least ppl to have lunch with. but while you get this at the junior level sometimes (not so much in A&E/anaesthesia/clinic settings, more in the wards), at the consultant level it’s more isolated. even the ward consultants - after rounding they go clinic to talk to patients all day. idk if they have anyone to eat lunch with. maybe u can ask @ doctorjaykay on ig  
  
2. “i basically started panicking about whether or not i’ll be able to handle the stress about being a HO/MO/resident etc”  
HO: not THAT bad. it’s scary at first but HOs are actually very sheltered bc no one trusts them and no one expects anything from them. they’re v closely supervised  
MO: can be quite chill if you’re not a resident, just a rotating MOPEX. the most stressful part is the uncertainty every 6 months when u have to ballot for next MOPEX posting and there’s a risk of getting thrown to some horrible hardship posting no one wants.  
Resident: I’ve never met a resident who is not chronically tired so this is a pretty valid concern. I’ve also been told one shouldn’t specialise unless one is really very passionate about doing that thing, bc residency is gruelling. (And it SHOULD be, bc once you finish and become a consultant, the buck stops with u leh u need to know ur shit. Ppl consult the consultant, there isn’t anyone higher up for the consultant to consult (ok la can ask for second opinion/ask other cons for help but u know what i mean))There are many paths other than residency. Ppl quit and GDFM, locum and start a side hustle. Go into non-clinical stuff. Basically, committing to medsch doesn’t mean committing to residency  
3. “i’ve heard from a lot of people that while maintaining a good work life balance is possible (albeit difficult) in med school, it gets harder as a houseman etc”  
HO: can laaaaa. not all HO postings are horrible so even if you kena a bad one it’s only for 4 months then hopefully u move on to a better place. i actually picked up one or two new hobbies during housemanship bc suddenly my free time didn’t have to be spent studying LOL  
MO: again, depends on the posting.  
Residency: as far i can tell, u probably gotta say byebye to work-life balance for a while haha

4. “i envy those around me that are unwavering in their decision to do medicine.”  
some caution is not unwise. anyone who is so unwavering in such a major life decision… no offense meant but i doubt them a little. u wait and see how many of them become jaded halfway through medsch and wanna quit. u rly dk what you’re getting into until ur in it haha

5. “additionally, i don’t think i can simply break the bond that comes with being a medical student”  
once you’re done with army you’d only have like idk 3-4 years of bond left? then maybe tahan for another year before deciding that u rly wanna quit. then ur almost done w the bond and it’s much less expensive to break by then HAHA. also by going to private locum land apparently u can make plenty of cash to afford to break (source: @ updatemeprn on ig. i suggest checking them out)

6. other thoughts  
Ppl have told me to consider what life is like as a consultant, rather than as a junior. Bc ur a con for the majority of your career, and life as a con is generally much better than any junior. Medicine is the long game la, have to ask yourself if you’re willing to wait for that delayed gratification. Bearing in mind the suffering is in the prime of your youth and your childbearing years. But all of that is assuming u go down the residency > consultant path  
That being said, other careers aren’t necessarily any better. Pretty sure in almost any field, juniors suffer for a good number of years to get gradually promoted and work their way up the ranks.  
Also want to say - in any other field, career paths can be a lot more nebulous and unpredictable, but that also means there’s a lot more flexibility and variety of opportunities. Sometimes I envy my friends who can just quit and go do smth completely different without much consequence haha.. but sometimes that’s not by their own choice and they end up in some job they hate just bc they couldn’t get anything else. Two sides to the coin. Medicine also got a lot of choices and career options, like,, policymaking, going out to advise insurance companies or pharmaceuticals.

at the end of the day you wanna find yourself in a job you can live with day in day out. not every day will be great, even if it's your passion. so yea it just has to be enjoyable enough that it doesn’t make you like hate yourself and your life"

marutan,3,"Not a doctor but my brother is one. Yes, the studying is pretty intense during the first 5 years, I hardly saw him because he was always in school or locked in his room just constantly memorizing thick-ass textbooks. Then came the 6th year (housemanship) and idk how he survived it. He would be in the hospital for like 3 days straight, come home, sleep for 24 hours then back to the hospital. He said there was literally no time to rest, and if you could find a surface to lie down and 20 mins to take a nap, you'd take it because you won't know when this opportunity would come again.

This was like 15+ years ago. Today he seems pretty content and happy with being a doctor and he doesn't have any plans to quit nor did he regret his decision to go into medicine. While there are crazy times during emergencies like when pandemic hit, he says that those are the exception and he enjoyed decent work-life balance. Also helps that he's making good money.

Also, just gotta add - somehow, during his med school days, despite his intense schedule, my brother managed to find time to date girls too. And I know he partied quite a bit with his med school classmates too. So it's not 100% no social life."
haisufu,3,">managed to get 90rp

congrats on the perfect score. in a way it does open up more options

&#x200B;

> i like the content, i like helping people

this is not a discouragement, but just a reminder. medicine is an applied science. if you like the content (and academic) side of things, you might be suited for a pure science degree / academia career to do research. if you like helping people, other healthcare professions do so, and perhaps to a greater extent than doctors. again, this is just something to keep in mind, not saying that you shouldn't be a doctor

&#x200B;

>i basically started panicking about whether or not i’ll be able to handle the stress about being a HO/MO/resident etc. as well as the lifelong studying and learning

I think this is a very valid concern to have, when choosing a career that is potentially lifelong at presumably 18yo. which is why some people have wondered if medicine should be a postgraduate endeavour like in the US - applicants would have a bit more life experience (as an adult) to make a more informed decision. technically this option exists in the form of Duke-NUS in Singapore. but obviously I doubt many would deliberately not apply for undergrad medicine just for this reason

several people have said that, as with other professions, hard work and long hours are to be expected, especially in the initial years. whilst I agree with that, do bear in mind that medicine is unique in that it directly impacts someone else's life. something done right could save a person's life, or something done wrong might cause death or serious disability. literally yesterday I had a 12-hour shift where a patient suddenly became unwell, with observations all over the place. the patient was still alive when I ended shift, but I can't deny there is the constant thought of 'could I have done more'. of course this is something that I am also trying to self-regulate. but you have to consider if you are able to handle this kind of psychological pressure, which may linger even after you head home. 

I've always felt that doctors (current or aspiring) have a certain element of masochism. this is perhaps where the passion that people talk about comes in. because why else would you knowingly enter a tough environment?

&#x200B;

>maintaining a good work life balance is possible (albeit difficult) in med school

med school is just 5 years; the rest of your career is 20-30-40+ years. you should be more concerned about the WLB for those decades beyond med school. the good news is that I think things are improving, albeit slowly. there are more people realising that just because things were like that in the past doesn't mean they should be exactly the same now.

&#x200B;

>may not be very indicative of life as a pgy

indeed. you are seeing someone who has probably slogged 10+ years ago and is now enjoying the relative blissful state. if possible try shadowing HOs or MOs as they will be more relatable to your perspective. ask them how they feel

ATB to your decision, whatever it may be"
urbumlife,6,"Was in the exact same shoes as you - a tip i can give is if you even have the slightest bit of doubt, DONT DO IT. This applies to any other degree ure considering and not just med - u have 90rp, dont waste it on a career path you regret later on. I went job shadowing after receiving my results and lets just say the doctor who was in charge gave me very harsh opinions on the industry as a whole. If youre not ready to slog for 10 years after graduating trying to pay your student loans whilst having minimum sleep, medicine is really not for you. Those who can survive are those with a dying passion who will not even think about ""can i survive"" etc and honestly, they do deserve to be called doctors because their passion for helping is unparalleled. So, do give it a serious thought although I can guarantee you that if you have doubts now, you should not do it."
bleachmyshorts,2,"Hi there, just happened upon this thread n thought I’d share my 2 cents.. I’m a junior doctor having worked for 5 years in the UK. On sabbatical atm because of burnout among other things. There’s always this weird cognitive dissonance whenever you ask a doctor whether you should do medicine. 98% will tell you not to medicine and pick something else because the job can make you really miserable for all the reasons you listed: stress, sleep deprivation- and yet they keep doing the job, if we’re being honest partly due to financial obligations but more often than not because they still love the job for the social utility, the science, the camaraderie etc. 
I feel reluctant to discourage you because you seem like a capable intelligent compassionate and enthusiastic person with a healthy sense of skepticism and good insight into your limitations - that is, it sounds like you would make a really good doctor. The caveat is that being a really good doctor will not necessarily make you happy. I know a handful of doctors who lead healthy and balanced lives outside of medicine, they go for marathons, are married with a family- I also know doctors who are burnt out and disillusioned with the job and are turning to other careers. (Bearing in mind work life balance may be different in SG compared to the UK) 

the main problem with medicine from my POV is that the working conditions can be inhumane. That you’re frequently expected to expend more resources than you possess, emotional, physical etc. in some environments it can be soul crushing and unsustainable. In other teams/wards/hospitals/areas it can challenge you to grow.
I would advise if possible trying to shadow an MO on an on call shift for a few hours (preferably at the end of their shift when they’re most worn out and close to a mental breakdown. (They will probably not enjoy having you around but that is kind of part of the experience)) to get a feel for the emotional and cognitive strain, to see how they’re treated and how they deal with it. At the very least, it should help you make a slightly more informed decision."
akireon,2,"Just saying man I feel you so much, I also want to do medicine since young but ever since I heard of the mental struggles + developing some mental health issues of my own I started to waiver. 

All im saying is go for it, the stress might be real and mental health would be tough, but that’s what med school is for, to prep you for that busy life. It rly does seem that you will be a great doctor in the future. Good luck, and hope to see you in med school!"

PlasticTourist3025,3,"Hcl: I think I said this somewhere else also, but try to revise and remember phrases from your 词语手册.  If you don't have pls buy it bc it's a lifesaver!!! When you're practising compre on your own, search the dictionary whenever there's any words/phrases that you don't know and write down the pinyin.  Also idk about now but a couple years back I bought this 成语 guidebook in secondary school and its superrr helpful so you might want to buy it if you don't have/read thru in your free time.  During your hcl exams, use pencil to briefly annotate the passage in eng so its easier to process/understand the gist. Ofc, you should be familiar with question types and answering techniques.  I suggest you consult your Chinese teacher too to find out where you went wrong.  Hcl is hard, a lot of ppl tend to do badly for internal exams but it's rly to train you for the actual Os. So keep your head up and don't be too disappointed 🏃‍♂️ it's easier to pass hcl Os than internal exams (most of the time)

Eng: for compre, be very familiar with question types and answering techniques. Its good to make notes on these.  Passages change all the time but the question types are more or less the same! Ofc I'll say consult your teacher, but it seems that your teacher has a lot going on for her (normal) so do ask your friends who are better.  When reading compre passages, vv important to annotate (basically I define annotation as rationalising what the passage says in a simplified way).  Make sure you are very clear about the context of the whole passage as well and don't look at one sentence/para in isolation.  For compo, read as many model essays as possible (esp those your teacher/school prints).  Take note of organisation and structure, highlight and remember good phrases.  You may want to practise writing paragraphs and let your teacher mark.  If you like writing argumentative/discursive, keep up with current affairs and maybe make an example bank.(will help in gp if you want to go jc too)

This resulted in me failing some of my exams very very badly (like single digit out of 30)....I was paranoid and anxious every day and it was bad.

My advice to you is:  find a comfortable learning environment that allows you to calm down and focus, and focus on one thing at a time. There's a lot of things for you to do and think about, but you can't solve all your probs at once.  When you don't know anything, ask your teachers/smarter friends for consult asap. Speaking about friends, you should interact more with friends that you can trust so yall can help each other out (v important!!). If they look down on you/unwilling to help, it rly shows the kind of person they are and you're better off asking your teacher.  Usually, most people won't see a prob with helping others in work unless you interrupt their concentration in lessons.

Lastly, you can talk to your ft if you're feeling overwhelmed from all your commitments, so they can make arrangements to help you and support your learning. Ofc you should also try to keep up with your tutorials and lectures, and make sure you understand the concepts asap to prevent snowballing(which gets vv stressful esp when exams are near).

Regardless of your A level rank point, if you chose one of the above mentioned courses and do not get in as the interview may not have went well, the chances of you getting the nus merit scholarship for your second choice course onwards is pretty low.

Of course, there are people who didn't succeed getting into Medicine etc getting offered a merit scholarship for their second choice courses. This meant that they had perform decently well for the interview, but unfortunately not well enough to make the cut for Medicine etc. But these people are few and far in between."

Can opt for SUTD SIT SUSS bah. Not too sure about other schs, but SUSS added ICT course. Maybe that's something you can try, assuming you like IT related courses.

some ppl like to do their own stuff without consulting the group. Ya they know their stuff. But looking down on people and being unable to communicate ideas or what one wants to do, will be troublesome. Some ppl think that they are the only capable ones and just take the whole proj and blame others for being slackers when they didnt hv the chance to do stuff

nvm you will exp all types of ppl

my friends came naturally, they may not be as good in projects, but at least no problems in communications and able to get the job done, I didnt mind doing most of it if I know how to do. So no problem for me.

Really dont like those social butterflies tbh. Fake friends, I rather dont hv them.

enter w an open mind. Dont be so fixated on 3.9, later get depression, for what??? Dont hv 3.9 wont die, there are many options. If you really did your best and cmi, prob means changing paths is a better choice. Life is too short to die over grades.

and you will hv to learn to work w diff ppl you know, not just the same group of friends. At work you cant choose your colleagues, you cant cry about it, hv to deal w it. Learn."

My point being, don't bother pinpointing the slackers, most people are mixed based on what subject they like, whether the rest of the team are slackers etc. Make friends with your teammates and they'll be encouraged to pull their weight.

lecomots,2,"Just get to know your classmates and also other people during orientation.. widen your social circle.. as for your studies, that's totally up to you. Not dependent on others. I was a mature student(30+yrs) in poly and graduated with 3.5 GPA. My classmate who was 50+yrs graduated with a 3.8 GPA. Another friend who was fresh from sec school also graduated within that range of GPA. All of us put in the necessary effort and we got what we wanted. Having a study group also will help you."
Ruin-Ready,2,"Honestly, consider separating your friends and your work! You can’t build meaningful friendships if the only value you see in them is if they contribute to your 3.9. They will see through you very quickly; no one likes being made use of. 

From my experience in poly people don’t always like to do group work with their friends, and some take the first semester or so to observe who works well/has a similar drive/working style! Those on the same wavelength would more or less want to work together, even if they weren’t close beforehand. Ultimately it also wouldn’t be ideal to put your friendships on the line for a group project because in doing group projects feelings will get hurt and with that additional layer of friendship, you guys will have to be incredibly mature and considerate to protect that. Otherwise you’ll end up with a lot of drama which I’m sure you wouldn’t want! 

I would say re-evaluate the value of friendship to you! Are friends just stepping stones to success or are you hoping to get to know and appreciate them as people? If your answer is the latter, you don’t have to worry about befriending slackers or underachievers — you can be friends with them and see value in them without feeling obliged to group with them in projects! If your answer is the former then good luck I doubt your friends would be staying for long (and I think you very much might be the problem) 

As for your 3.9, just do your best and pull your weight! Have a good humble learning attitude and never assume you’re too good for anything or anyone !! I will be graduating with a 3.8ish gpa but I started out with 3.33 for my first sem! It’s possible to pull yourself up but it’s important that you enjoy what you’re doing and that you constantly seek to improve!! 

All the best :^DDD"

thejuniorbanker,1,"I graduated as valedictorian in my university. While I won’t say they are the same, there’s some similarities in poly v uni life. 

Be excellent in what you do, give it your best shot, and stay humble. You’ll find that the people you want to work with will eventually ‘come’ to you because you live out what you expect in others. Birds of a feather. Your community will also evolve along the way, and that’s fine.

1. there may be past year papers provided if needed but a lot of modules are usually revised and updated from time to time so papers from many years ago are not relevant

Basically its never ending, once you reach your closest goal, another one emerge. Like many redditors said before ‘comparison is the thief of joy.

Looking back now after 3 years, all the stress, burnout, anxiety and unhealthy behaviour I suffered due to the constant desire to outperformed myself really took a toll on me and made my 3 years pretty miserable. Spent nearly no time actually ‘experience’ the poly journey as I merely ‘lived’ in the poly journey. With that being said, if I was to do it all over again, I would probably double down on my academic pursuit since well, as I said previously the ‘chase’ for academic success you believe is ‘satisfactory’ will never stop once you start."
avocadohater3000,6,"For 99% of people, there's always going to be someone performing better than us. It's impossible to be satisfied if you're always comparing yourself to others.

Mahsunon,41,more accurate than the recent one posted but this is like more of a explanation of laptop components than a guide as to how to go about picking a laptop
usernamesarehated,9,"CPU

ARM/apple has best battery life. Pretty sure you don't need to bring a charger to school since the battery life is so good. If you don't need DGPU and don't mind macos, M1/m2 macbooks are the best laptop cpus you can get rn imo. 

AMD is also more efficient than intel when it comes to regular productivity workloads. This is a good middle ground between battery life and performance. Good for people who want windows and longer battery life. Go for amd if you're looking for a windows laptop using IGPU, something that is less powerful for regular productivity tasks. 

Intel has the strongest X86 CPUs from 12th gen onwards, their H series CPUs beat AMD in multithread due to addition of efficiency cores. Highly recommended getting 12th/13th gen H series if you need something powerful like gaming laptop. 


CHARGING

Another factor that you should consider is usb c charging. If your laptop has usb c charging, you can buy a 65w gan pd charger and save weight/space in your bag. No need to carry around the big charging adapters that your laptop comes with. You can also buy power banks that has pd and charge your laptop on the go. 

Unfortunately if you're buying a gaming laptop you'll still need to bring the large charger along and plug it in to get full performance. 


RAM

Depending on how many programmes and tabs you open you'll need more ram. 16gb will be ok for most people. 32gb is really helpful if you like to multitask or open 100 tabs and not close your applications. If you're running intensive application then more ram is better."

my class had a less than 50% passing rate at the end of sec 3, im pretty sure in sec 3 WA1 we only had 3 passes LOL. then by prelims the cohort passing rate was 66.6% (majority from the other amath class). things werent looking good at all LOL, but somehow n someway my cohort pulled through O’s with a 98.5% passing rate (btw ard 60-62 ppl take amath for my batch so if you do the math, only 1 person failed). so its perfectly okay to fail amath at the start, o lvl is actl easier 👍🏻"

because it really does take a lot of time to master the concepts and recognise the structure in amath questions. i would advise you to practise amath consistently (every day do a few questions from tb or select questions from exam papers you can find from holy grail). even better get topical tys if you don't have it and practice all the questions in it at your own time. all the best, you've got this :)"

mathboi97,2,"Well yes but actually no.

The first learning curve for Add Math is massive algebruh (and long strings of calculations before getting your answer). Usually the probability of careless mistakes is quite high in said calculations. You can put trigonometry in this category too.

The second learning curve, to be precise, is vocabulary. This is what many commenters mentioned about getting used to it. It’s like getting used to a new language. You can put, among other topics, differentiation and integration (i.e. calculus) into this.

The beautiful thing is that you can target these two curves via consistent practice! And there’s a wealth of online help too, so feel free to leverage that."

ilyas_4_real,1,It is esp since A maths is a bit more tricky than E maths. Plus sch papers tend to be harder than the actl O level ones. However w a lot of practice you can do well in it. I went from F9 to B3 just by practicing. Prb could have gotten an A2 if I practiced w time.

milkdaze,1,"Hello, just wanted to share my experience that failing amath at the start is completely normal.
My first amath wa1 got f9 and i remember being very demoralised by it and wanting to give up on the subject haha. Luckily for me, my amath teacher was very supportive and for my next exam i got c6, i was so proud that i passed that subject (and i deproved right after but we dont talk abt that). There were definitely some ups and downs in my grades for amath until the last few months before o level when i started to do a lot of amath papers every day as if i have no life and got that a1 for amath in olvls.
all i can say is amath is really a subject that requires practice, just seek help from your teachers for any queries you have and don't worry if you didn't meet your expectations for the first few tests. All the best for your future exams !!"

I second the comment about exercise, it really helps to take your mind off things.  All the best op, stay strong! ❤"
Fitgwen1,6,"I think you should go out and exercise. I used to have very bad OCD. But I started an exercise regime. Exercise do help. It’s suppose to give you happy hormone. When I have any troubles, after exercising. The troubles seems like nothing. You don have to run if you don like to run, I just do brisk walking. Give it a try.

FlqmeDeqth,14,"1. My grades dropped alot too (also mainly because i have not been revising properly) e.g chem dropped from A to fail 
2. Will be tough considering that myes is reaching soon. But thats not to worry as ur end goal is still A levels. Some Bs are alright
3. Usually JC standards stay the same in terms of paper difficulty
4. TYS / School shld usually give u materials to do

Dont worry as this is normal and since u already got 90rp in j1, your studying techniques work and you just have to take a step back, evaluate where did you go wrong and keep pushing."
Ok-Lock4799,5,"1. I dropped from 88.75rp in promos to almost 60rp in CT1s lol. I had a very severe injury which kinda prevented me from revising and studying much. Also overloaded on commitments during j2 term 1 which resulted in my dismal performance. After a lot of mugging during June hols my RP went up to 75 and by prelims it was back at 87.5rp. So yeah, it's definitely possible to improve by prelims at least, as long as you're willing to put in the effort by catching up on what you've missed on. Remember to practise a lot and seek consults to clarify doubts early!
3. Depending on school, prelims will be easier than all other sch exams. I was from RI, and this was the case for us.
4. Holy grail and your sch's past year papers are your best friend. Other than these and TYS, I don't remember doing anything extra"
Alone_Abrocoma_9666,5,"1. my grades/percentages dropped too! (my econs especially bad went frm a 88 to a <45…) i think in the beginning of j2 it’s ok to cut yourself some slack i mean you’re most prob busy w events and cca

2. i had straight Bs in myes… i think focus more in getting consistent again bcus straight As suddenly may not be possible 

3. realistically speaking, j2 papers are harder bcus more content to learn, more content to test, longer tests also but it’ll become manageable so dw! rn it may seem harder bcus you’re still learning the syllabus so and getting used to the diff types of qns but over time it’ll be more familiar (esp for macro econs ok! macro econs was my fav bcus AFTER you learnt all the issues then macro econs becomes more of a understanding concept that you can pluck out things to use in the qn where applicable bcus all the topics are superrr interrelated so def take some time and see more qns! the qns are usually p standard too - causes, effects, strategies, conflicting goals/comparing strategies + the evaluation for macro has sm more leeway for you to explore so grab those marks as much as you can by writing abt anything related) 

4. ngl your jc should give you enough bcus there’ll be rev packages once your syllabus ends and you’ll have tys too! do try other sch papers tho so exposure but your main concern should be to finish what you have for jc rn

firstly i want to say good job for your j1! usually people struggle to build a solid foundation in that yr but you seem to have done p well in that so just push on w it :) also if i have any advice it would be to ask for help asap when you find something off (basically i’m not saying that you have vv little time this yr to wreck your brain solving math qns or something) ask your tutors and exam skills too! my econs tutor helped me a lot in making sure that all i knew in theory could be shown in my exams and i became p consistent aft that, also realizing that the issue wasn’t that i couldn’t do econs but i couldn’t ans the qn properly… but just good luck for now!"
Admirable-Brick-2940,2,"1. my grades dropped slowly from j1 until start of j2 but i was also rly shocked when i got my first tests back in j2 (i cried) cos i went from A to B then to DEF in j2 and i was on the verge man Bahahhaha
2. depends on u but prob not possible, doing poorly in j2 is damn normal though :))
3. yes actually it gets harder esp when u start grinding prelim papers i legit thought i was studying wrongly or the wrong syllabus or sth when i started doing prelim papers LMAOOOO
4. Jiayous! rmb that A levels is the final goal, doesnt matter how u do in j2 as long as by the end ure ready :)"

xLousycatx,65,"I think the core population here aren’t working professionals in either field, maybe this specific subreddit is the wrong place for that question ."
Not_Cube,21,IMO it's very tough to debate since they're vastly different skillsets
momokplatypus,17,"I know lawyers and doctors - not either myself. The different subject matter and skills aside, and just thinking about what my friends have been through, I’d say doctors have it harder. Of course, this is from very limited, anecdotal experience. 

1. Length of training: 5-6 years for doctors (depending on uni) + additional training in your sub-specialty (~ 3 years for GPs - 7 years for neurosurgeons). Compared to 3-4 years for lawyers + pupillage (1 year in UK, not sure about here). 

2. Amount of studying - this is just my feel from observing friends, but the medics seemed to be constantly studying. 

3. Amount of responsibility for juniors: Even  doctors new in residency can be the most knowledgeable person in the room with a patient, making calls that nurses follow. I don’t know if any of my lawyer friends had that level of responsibility during their pupillage. (That is, if we take the practical part of training as part of the educational experience). 

4. Academic preparation prior to starting med/law school: this is a US-specific thing, maybe. I know people who went to graduate med and law school in the US. I know people with mediocre grades who tested into a law school by doing well in the LSAT. They didn’t go to great law schools,  and they’re working as lawyers now. In contrast, all the people I know who went to medical school had spectacular grades. And they had to do really hard pre-med classes.

5. Having to learn to deal with death: I think this is the part of training to do your job that doctors HAVE to learn and lawyers don’t really have to. My psychiatrist told me about the first time a patient of hers killed himself after she’d signed off on him. She was in her first year of psychiatry training - she went to her supervisor, who said, basically, dealing with patient suicide was an occupational hazard of psychiatry, and that as a senior psychiatrist he’d had _many_ patients suicide over his long career. [Caveat: My lawyer friends all do corporate law … maybe if they were criminal defence lawyers they’d be dealing with murder cases?]"
ireallyhatedriving15,36,"I think this is the wrong place since the demographic here are mostly students, but on the medical school subreddit, a recent post mentioned that a lot of people compare the rigour of their course with medical school (engineering vs medical school, law vs medical school, etc)

bandung_girl,1,imo you both have highly and equally respected professions. Not sure about difficulty but the amount of time of studying and training required to be a specialist doc like ur friend is more certainly longer than what it takes to be a lawyer(correct me if I'm wrong!!).

for info, i did not take amaths and received C6 for emaths olvl (💀). cgpa (5 sems) is 3.8x and i was accepted into SMU IS via early admission / discovery day. 

for NUS, i applied for its computing courses too (BZA & IS). i did take the university mathematics preparatory course and thankfully passed (uh barely though hahaha) but even then, i’m still having doubts that they will accept me since i heard that it’s a case-to-case basis for those who obtained the cert but dh amaths (not sure how true this is though). so ig only time will tell if i’ll be accepted into the course 😁

PERSONALLY, i kind of regretted not taking amaths as a priv candidate when i was in poly. i contemplated it but decided not to in the end. at the same time, idt i would hv gotten a decent gpa if i was studying for amaths olvl while juggling my poly projects. 

so, my advice is: if you are completely sure that retaking your amaths will not affect your gpa, i’d say go for it since you alr have the basics (not learning it from zero like me, if i were to take amaths in poly)."

singaporean-kid,1,"Your subject combination has little resources available, especially for H2 Principles of Accounting and H2 Management of Business. I suggest you find someone from Millennia Institute to guide you for these subjects. 

I took H2 Management of Business at the A Levels and it isn’t really a difficult subject to study, the key problem lies in the application of business concepts into the case studies, which costs students their marks. You must also understand their rubrics and marking style in order to get a quality grade. I got an A for MOB so I could be of help if you so desire. 

H2 Principles of Accounting is vastly different from O Level POA. Do check the syllabus document if you can.

If you are from a business course in Poly, these subjects should be somewhat understandable for you.

Good luck."

PlasticTourist3025,2,"Chinese: read as many Chinese model essays as possible and take note of the organisation/flow.  Highlight the good phrases and memorise them. Actually it's quite good that you're watching stuff that can help ur Chinese!! I'll rec watching the Chinese news as it can help you in oral.  For oral, practise reading slowly without stumbling over the phrases. You *need* to read aloud to hear yourself.  Even better if you can practise 1 to 1 with a friend/sibling/relative to simulate the actual oral setting.  Next, when practising oral/compre in your own time, always search up the phrases that you don't know and write down the meaning and pinyin.  When you're doing compre in exams, you can also write down the meaning of some phrases in English next to the Chinese words (so its less tedious to read).  Ofc, you should also familiarise yourself with all the textbook Chinese phrases.  I always revise from the 词语手册 which is a lifesaver.  Lastly, make sure you know all the answering techniques for compre, and spam your tys 🏃‍♂️

Science: do topical practice on those topics that you don't know. You should do this early on to build your foundation.  Make sure you're familiar with definitions and concepts too.  I think making notes does help when you have trouble memorising, I used to make flowcharts and mindmaps.  Also if you're weaker, ask ur teacher/smarter friends ASAP when you don't know anything.  I'll say chem needs more memorising than phy so yeah you'll have to spend more effort in that area.  Ofc practising tys is good but make sure you know the individual topics well first

Ss: time management (don't spend too long on one qn) and be familiar with your textbook content(will also help in your sbq).  I used someone's notes from this subreddit 😭😭.  Also consult your teacher one on one for feedback on your work.  I feel like for ss, you need to know some current affairs so stay up to date with the news!!(if you're planning to go jc this will help with gp too)"

phy uh olvl i got a1 lolol basically since the start of sec3 after every topic my tvher went thru i did tys tipical and gave it to my teacher and forced jim to mark it in front of me during consult. its nr too late to start now! book a consult thm syart doing tys. bc u have a deadline. if nt u might js keep procrastinating and we wouldnt want thr would we. ya so mark in front of me w the answer scheme la thn aft the consult go thru my mistakes and misconceptions. i also do sch papers and yearly tys nearing Os. no i did not finish the whole book oops so if u nvr finish the whole book issok bc u have been consistent alr a few more papers wont do anything man calm calm

chem i got a2 fml ive been getting consistent a1s ever since term 3 of sec3 so im rlly salty but srsly the chem paper is another whole level of difficult either or electrolysis fml anyw same for phy yk those books the activity ws like same publisher for textbook and workbook i bought the workbook (by mistake) thn oh wells js do lor thn since the first chapt i give my chem teacher mark yes they r the sweetest<3 thn book consult to point out misconceptions thn if idk anyt they teach in class i stop them frm proceeding to the next class until i ask my qns LOL i mean i also got chem tuitionwhich boost my grade frm b4 in term1 to a2 in term2 in sec3 

ss js draw mindmap and source examples. i get school exam papers and collate al their examples in diff chapters into and example pool and use them whenever. i also do other sch paper (the sbq) and let tvher mark bc the answering techniques r the most important shit i tell u ur examples no good still ok but wah the skills

v1ncent_vg,1,"hi! don't have experience as a private candidate but in general, i think it's very important to receive feedback for english + ss/hist cause both of these subjects don't have definitive answers. practising frequently is also very important for these subjects as you'll get exposure to the types of qns asked + how to answer them. you'll also get used to writing quickly, but i'd recommend timed practices once you understand a majority of the concepts. (if you're wondering, i had tuition for both while i was taking o's, my ss/hist went from d7 before tuition to a1 during o's and my english went from c5/6 consistently to a1 during o's)

it's good to read the news for english + ss, maybe read the news whilst on public transport or set aside a few minutes every day to read up on what's going on. if you use social media a lot, follow news accounts on whatever platforms you use. for ss/hist specifically, you only have to memorise enough to answer an essay, which means you can choose what to memorise. for hist i recommend you memorise a few factors for every topic instead of spotting topics as the topics you end up memorising may have super specific qns that are difficult to write multiple points for (example the 2021 o's 2.a i think, the one about the nuremberg laws, i remember asking my teacher about how to answer that qns and she said the hist dept didn't really know either)

Also you can study during your travel time, 1h+ per trip is quite a lot of time, I picked a JC near my place (15min) for that reason. If you study during your commute then you’ll have more free time at night.

Also, if your school records and uploads lectures / classes online you can consider skipping them and watching them on your commute, saves time too. My JC uploads the lectures online so I’d skip them and download them and watch at 2x speed to save time"

Get friends from other classes. Most of my closest friends that I still talk to today were in fact not from my class.

>How do people even have an enjoyable time in jc… The people here are too arrogant and for what? I dont even understand why they have to behave like this

It's inaccurate to generalize based on such a small sample size. There are annoying people everywhere. The worse one when you grow up is deal with annoying people with *money and time,* that would be the true hellscape.

JC isn't mean't to be an enjoyable time btw. You are there to study and get through the guillotine in 2 years. Friends are optional. ""90 rp is forever"" as some commenters here will say.

&#x200B;

>I hope to make at least one friend here soon, at least that would make things more bearable.

I don't see how this isn't possible unless you are a total cunt tbh. So just join some CCAs or study groups. Naturally you will make some friends.

>Picking jc is one of the worst decisions of my life.

Maybe. Too early to call that the worst. I used to think picking PFM back in NUS was one of the most trash decisions in my life (wanted to be an economist). Getting a nice paper has set me up for a nice paycheck now. At least for me not drowning thanks to inflation in exchange for 'A' level + NUS grinding was well worth it. I get to buy Diablo 4 without feeling the pinch in my wallet.

Ultimately if you feel you will fail 'A' levels, it's better to go Poly. 'A' levels is brutal in punishment if you screw it up, though less so in today's context with SUSS & SIT. We didn't have those in my time, it was straight Fedx to Australia if you failed."
ihavenoidea90s,47,"I spent a year in JC before switching to poly. In that year I lost 15kg, was tired all the time and had no motivation to do anything. Friends were all either extremely studious or like me, was failing all my modules and couldn't proceed to J2. Environment was very depressing and I dreaded going to school everyday. 

Enrolled in poly, and what a massive difference, lecturers treating students as adults, freedom to do your own work and projects, *wearing your own clothes to school omg...* And the various different f&b locations on campus. 

Poly was the best 3 years of my life, not exaggerating."
PlasticTourist3025,32,"I don't know the full context of your situation, but if your classmates' behaviour is repeated and consistent, and affecting your ability to do well, you should try to sound it off to your ft when you are able to (eg during those one to one feedback sessions things, but if you think you can't wait then you should just drop your ft a text asap).  At the end of the day, you shouldn't feel that your capabilities and efforts are held back just because a couple of people in your class choose to be crappy.  I agree with the other comment that you should surround yourself with people (from other classes and CCA) who can motivate you and whom you can feel happy around, it can be way more helpful than what you expect.  Honestly, everyone in jc can make and have friends, it just takes a while sometimes! However, you're still gonna have to see and work with your classmates in sch every day, so you should still try to maintain good rapport with them. If they don't want to its really their loss and you shouldn't force it at the expense of your mental wellbeing.  

Op, you're much more capable than you think, please don't let these people bring you down. None of us should have to encounter these situations esp in an already academically stressful environment.  However, take it in your stride as everyone has faced/is facing some variation of this in their own lives. ATB, I'm sure you'll pull through and emerge stronger <3"

Dry_Ad3657,29,"Hii!! Yeah not every department can deliver the best for their students unfortunately. Just a heads up, this may only be helpful in the long run in J2, but holy grail is a useful place with lots of prelim papers and answers. In J2 mid years, you could probably benefit a fair bit from doing and studying the answers/go for consultations if you don't understand certain answers. 

Another more immediate solution is go for tuition and make sure you ask when you're unsure, or spam your school teachers with consultations during or after school!"

math_dydx,17,">Notes: long, wordy and utterly confusing. Explanation of certain concepts are lacking compared to other JCs' notes.

I can confirm this after reading my CJC tutees' Physics notes a few years ago. Disorganised content and unclear explanations throughout the notes. No wonder their students don't understand what's going on, misconceptions everywhere and even simple first topic measurements vector addition also don't know how to do when it is already June of J1.

PS: Lucky my tutees from CJC few years ago came from a rich family background that sends their kids for tuition in almost all subjects, even for H1 Physics. Lucky because of tuition they still can get 60+/70+ RP , and go to some NTU course, and SIT. If no tuition, I think their RP will be a lot worse."
jay_ongoing,11,Now that I've seen this post. This really made me feel somewhat relieved for my unsuccessful appeal to cjc.
uxc1154,10,"Was in CJC Science stream also (physics and chem) 

I used CJC notes extensively throughout my J1 and J2 and I had the complete opposite experience. I did hear many complaints about CJC’s notes so throughout J1, as a kiasu student, I would cross reference other schools notes (can find on holy grail-> holy water). 80% of the time I found CJC’s notes better. After I consistently scored high As for my exams and self mock exams using CJC notes, I  became very confident in the quality of CJC notes so no longer did this. 

I found that CJC’s notes focus on explaining important foundational concepts as opposed to some other schools that focus on explaining things that are less important/relevant or don’t explain things properly at all.

I feel that many people grow to dislike CJC’s notes (and lecture, teachers etc) because everyone keeps shitting on them. As a result, when people face difficulties, instantly start blaming CJC instead of having self accountability and grit to just push through. You can maybe try to block out the negativity, studying with a better mindset.

However, I may be wrong. It is possible that CJC’s notes are tragic for most but for some reason suited me well. In that case, you can use other schools lecture notes to study or, as I did in J1, use more than 1 lecture notes. I can tell you that even if CJC’s explanations are so bad, they still adhere to the syllabus outcomes given by MOE. So if using other notes teaches drastically different content…

hope you find this insightful and eventually figure out something that works for you.

JigglyBlueCat,0,"Hi! I took Chem at H2 at CJC and graduated just this year, I was able to get an A for my Chem. From my experience the CJC Chem lecture notes were actually quite good. That said, I found it especially useful to make summaries after each Chem chapter (These summary maps were more useful for org chem in j2 though). For the SLS lectures, I watched them at like 2x speed and skipped most of the bits where they read out the lecture notes, I also skipped all the worked examples in the lecture notes too. But I did use Anki, a flashcard studying app a lot during my JC which I found critical to scoring well. (You should try it out, Anki is a much more superior studying method that I only picked up around the end of J1)

All in all, don't worry too much if you're just in term one. My MYE for chem in j1 was an S and I only really started studying for chem after that. Good luck!"

Silver-Recording-788,13,"tbh i was once in ur situation- class topper for elective Hist in sec 4 but when it came to prelims a big fat c6 as i couldn’t make an inference from the source which was hard for me and i cried my eyes out to my Hist teacher. (i think i also underperformed for the same reasons and got a B4 for SS in prelims too- again before that i was always an A1) as O levels were literally a month or so away i freaked the hell out but i pulled myself tgt, drilled Hist tys and tried several SS SBQ papers and went to see my Teachers for regular consults- 

It worked! A1 at O levels :) on hindsight the reason i did badly was that closer to prelims i prioritised other subjects over Hist/SS and didn’t practise enough questions to get myself up to the exam rigour- maybe u should evaluate ur revision system and see if it’s because ur neglecting SS practise or just mindlessly mugging content for SS and don’t even leave time for practising papers (which is v detrimental). I think ur in sec 4? So, consider seeing ur SS teacher more regularly for consults like once a fortnight with a new school paper attempted and ask ur teacher for past year O level papers to try out, then again bring to her to mark! 

I get that u are a straight A student and ur teacher had expectations of u (honestly i wish I thought if this at ur age) 

Just cuz you were doing well all the time so far, doesn’t mean you are not allowed or not entitled to have ur moments of failure/ falls like everyone else. Everyone will have expectations of you, that’s a given but at the end of the day no one’s judgment of you rlly is valid/ matters because they don’t know how much you’ve sacrificed to study and do well- they didn’t see ur hidden struggle and so their “disappointment” in you has no gravity. The only reason why their negative judgment of you bothers u so much is because u give it weight- the moment u take that away u’ll feel so free and better about urself! 

Imo the way ur teacher reacted was also too harsh and took the wrong approach in handling the situation by adding onto the student’s feelings of shame and frustration by showing clear disappointment but don’t take it too harshly because she/he is human too and perhaps couldn’t be as professional as she/he should’ve been due to their own shock at ur performance which is fine- 

these things happen, idt she/he meant to hurt u lah. Hang in there OP!"

NoSeaworthiness313,270,Wtf only 3h2 n GP for 2024 and beyond. Feels bad for the current 2023 batch
ThaEpicurean,150,"Definitely easier than our batch. With more perfect scorers likely to be produced, portfolio/h3 subjects will probably be more essential for universities to differentiate perfect scorers for competitive courses. Basically, instead of having academic stressors, students will be pressured to develop other qualities to stand out from the rest. 

Probably a good thing for students tho, since they will have more time for themselves to have fun and stuff while simultaneously having enough time to chase a perfect RP. (Assuming they're not interested to stand out and are happy with only a perfect RP)"
keng1221,86,MOE may make GP and H2 content subjects harder…
TheMadao,147,No H1 and PW inside total UAS/rank points anymore. Future JC students gonna have it lucky since these subjects usually denied people from getting a perfect score.
International-Ad7621,35,I reckon there will be more in fighting and back stabbing to fight for the various limited leadership posts
Legitimate-Ask-8820,23,"With these changes, it is easier for students to be able to enter universities and have access to a greater range of courses as they have more time to work on their 3h2s and GP instead of focusing too much on their PW or H1s. Thus students from low/mid-tier schools can strategise better to earn a high RP.  
However, for students aiming to enter competitive courses, the situation will become way more competitive. It is hard to say whether more people will get the max rank points since the new GP syllabus is supposedly harder, but a significant proportion of people will be stuck in getting GP B and 3H2s A. This means that in order to stand out in rank points for courses that do not require an interview/portfolio, they must get A for H1 and MT. Getting GP C or below would be very detrimental. It will also become more important to build your portfolio or to take up H3 subjects for those who are not confident with getting A for GP. So this change will also cause high RP scorers to suffer in terms of admissions and scholarship applications."
xavierang2,21,"The reason why MOE introduced compulsory contrasting subjects, which students usually take at the H1 level, is to encourage multidisciplinary learning. I feel that the recent changes contradict what contrasting subjects set out to do, since more students will not pay attention to their contrasting subjects anymore as they are only considered if they better the UAS. Even if they do better the UAS, additional points gained from H1 rebase will likely be minimal.

I think that the following change should be done instead, allowing students to still take the best grades from their content subjects while still placing some emphasis on contrasting subjects:

GP (compulsory 10 RPs)   
plus  
Best 6 AUs (60 RPs) out of 7 from the 3 H2s and 1 H1  
plus  
MT rebase if they better the UAS  
Total 70 RPs

So for example:  
GP - C (1 AU: 7.5)  
1st H2 - E (2 AUs: 5+5)  
2nd H2 - B (2 AUs: 8.75+8.75)  
3rd H2 - A (2 AUs: 10+10)  
H1 - A (1 AU: 10)  
MT - Depends on whether grade will better UAS after rebasing

GP compulsory so 7.5  
Then I will take the best 6 AUs out of 7 so 10+10+10+8.75+8.75+5=50  
Total UAS: 7.5+50=57.5

Using MOE’s new system:  
Score without H1: 7.5+10+17.5+20=55  
Rebased score with H1: (70/80)\*(7.5+10+17.5+20+10)=56.875

This places equal importance on contrasting subjects as other subjects, especially for some students who do better in their contrasting subjects, unlike MOE's new system which gives a smaller number of additional points for doing well in contrasting subjects."
CaramelWild1465,17,"For the boys taking A level exam this year, can they focus just on the 3 H2 only, since they can apply in 2026 after their NS?"
thesausagetrain,16,"National exams are fundamentally about rankings anyway. It's all relative toThe system changes don't really change too much in that regard. 

The exception will be at the top end, because it's now easier to score a perfect score, which will probably place more emphasis on aptitude (BMAT, interviews, selection tests, H3, portfolio)."
RagingGods,24,"Easier to do? Yes.     
Easier to score well? Hardly. Since A levels is still about bellcurve/moderation, reducing the difficulty nation-wide is just going to force the competition between the remaining subjects harder. If everyone can score on average higher by 5 points, then the grades per score is going to increase by 5 points."

DrowzyHippo,8,"now is the time to consider tuition classes if u aren't already enrolled. as for self-studying, for math and science subjects, i find that targeting my weakest subjects by spamming questions is most effective. try to memorise content chapter by chapter, and after u memorise a chapter try to see if u can remember the previous chapters' content. for example, if i have 5 chapters to study, after studying chapter 2 i will see if i still remember chapter 1 content, and after studying chapter 3 i will see if i remember chapters 1 and 2 content. this way, u can easily go back and revise again while retaining a lot of ur thought processes."

kaiser01233210,19,"Hey so I'm not going to convince you to go but I'll tell you some outcomes of you not going 

- You are going to be the social outcast because cliques form at a snap of a finger, when you realise you get the leftover shitters you are going to majorly regret your choice of not socialising or having some understanding which classmate is useful or stupid if you are a GPA hunter and want to Gacha/RNG/Coinflip your groupmates.

-You will suffer even more since poly tutorials are not like primary/secondary, the vibe is just different and the full 2hrs lesson slot is used for work, not even small talks even with your teacher sometimes. Your classmates probably have friends from other classes/courses so your going to be awkwardly scrambling for a group if you don't mind being a loner.

- My personal story albeit it was during the 2021 where covid was around so not sure if orientation is the same but it was a 2-hr tour around my school canteen and the classrooms, I spoke to 2 people about simple things such as why they came to the course or how they were feeling at the moment, simple intro stuff nothing to pull your hair over.

The next 2 day, lesson started and I saw many people already forming their 4-5 cliques/group which basically set the social circle for my class throughout the year and I was fortunate enough the 2 lads I chatted with ended up being reliable friends and groupmates from the interactions we had on orientation which made us want to connect more with one another."
Zaptr0s,4,"Whether it's compulsory depends on your school, but it's a good idea to go. I believe there will be briefing and a little admin stuff there, and get to know your form teacher. Lessons start immediately from day 1 so there's no first week to chill and get to know classmates

It isn't exactly a big social event since from my experience it's just with your class. And as the previous guy said getting friends early on is quite important in poly, since there will always be group work and getting with slackers is the worst possible thing to your head and grades."
scams-are-everywhere,3,"Hellos! Like most other things out of the curriculum in poly, orientation is optional, but I would encourage you to go at least for the first day in case there’s any important admin stuff done before that/to try it out as you may never know what will happen,, your poly life is really what you make of it ;)"
JenniferXeno,2,"My year didn’t have orientation due to COVID. However I was a student mentor for 2021 NYP Freshman orientation so I’ll kinda give you an idea what the orientation is like (at least for that year)

It was a 2 days orientation (1 day physical, 1 day virtual) due to COVID. For my group, 1st day was physical and 2nd day was virtual. My group had around 20 people.



Physical:
Your standard orientation (ice breaker games, group exercise)
Admin stuff

Virtual:
Minigames (eg. Guess the cartoons)
Q&A about studies (if you have any questions for your seniors, this might be a good place to ask them personally)



At the end of day 1, I could already see cliques form and class representatives were already chosen (if you are interested in a leadership role). Private class chat (Whatsapp and Discord) were also setup for random stuff and they were very active during and right after orientation ended.

At the end of the orientation, you can definitely get a sense of who might have similar interest as you (my group had a lot of jokers lol) and be able to make friends from there.

I can’t say if you’ll definitely have fun, but you’ll definitely be able to get a vibe of your class and a general overview of most classmates which will help you to form groups in poly. Your classmates will also get an impression of you (after all, why would they want to choose you over another classmate? Common interest? Attitude?)"

Relevant_Ad9708,1,"i think it does more harm than good to not go tbh. most friends are formed at orientation. u might as well go and find one friend who is like u/easy going and u can stick w them throughout orientation so it’s less scary. i get that anxiety can be overwhelming but the anxiety of going to sch when ori is over and knowing no one then having to make friends by yourself and doing everything on ur own is even more intense imo. it’s better to go and get acquainted with the school first. even tho it’s a big social event there’s prob a lot of nervous ppl and ppl will be too busy to be focused on u, as compared to when u come to sch and everyone notices u bcs they didn’t meet u at orientation. just my opinion! atb"
studycookie,100,"(unrelated) how the heck did you do A-levels while also in POLY, as a JC kid I’m impressed.

CloudlessEveningSky,1,"I think you might be able to gain even more insights if you ask yourself, what would you like to work as after uni, and from there you can truly weigh the value of having your poly diploma as a back-up and addition to your portfolio.

Are you certain that you will want to stay in a role relevant to your major in the future? And how will having a diploma in addition to your uni cert be able to contribute to your portfolio for potential future roles. If you are in a stem diploma, it is possible to advance to diploma plus or advance diploma in specialised stem fields, so might wanna consider having such options around as a factor."

I think if you're looking for the $, then u could go into private healthcare. With the ageing population, private physio is gonna get even more popular. You would still need to rough it out a few yrs though for the experience, likely in a public hospital. Then go into private practice once you are experienced enough."
Khainesg,7,"I think healthcare will always be in demand and like someone says, SG is facing an aging population and physiotherapy will be one of those in demand areas. But it's not just for senior citizens, physiotherapy is also required for post surgery (my wife still goes after her cancer surgery), sports related injuries and just normal sprains (for myself once in a while when I sprain my back or ankle)

Finance, yes, you earn big money, but its high risk and one of the areas which gets retrenched often when times are bad. Have you heard of people in healthcare getting retrenched?

And it's not as though you start your first job and get the high pay as well...

Do what you like, live within your means and who knows what pathways will be available down the road? Like some mentioned, you can work for public, private healthcare or later even strike out your own and start your own physio clinic."

Honestly, I've seen my friend with 82rp get in (he got rejected by smu law which was even more LOL), and a friend with 88rp fail to get in. IMO >85 should be safe to get into interviews at least.

For now, I cannot overemphasize the need to be well read. Sounds stupid but watch YouTube (John Oliver, B1M, LegalEagle to name some of my favourite). In addition to it just being a good skill to have, it can come in useful for the interview/ test.

And yea the ntu prof told us that they were switching to ucat test for 2024 admissions onwards he also told us the ucat test mainly tests your c̶h̶e̶m̶i̶s̶t̶r̶y̶ k̶n̶o̶w̶l̶e̶d̶g̶e̶  and decision making skills ( no biology ) so it shld be pretty manageable.

PlasticTourist3025,0,"Hiii I took pcml(h1 lit) for a levels!! Just like you I feel more passionate about language and literary arts so I took my subj combi. Might be biased here, but I think your subject combination is quite broad in the sense that you also can pursue STEM jobs while still being in touch with the humanities.

Honestly I don't think your subject combination will put you at a disadvantage if you want to pursue english/lit in uni (literally has no subject requirement, you just need to do well in gp/ki).  However, I think you should look at the job prospects of lit/English which I think is kind of limited. Ig can you can go into publishing/teaching/journalism/advertising, but are these jobs that you want to do in the future?  Or do you want to be able to pursue STEM jobs as a backup? Also, what are the subjs you can see yourself studying, and you think will help you secure a good a level mark?

The above qns are important and should be thought about because it will help you decide whether to take lit as a h1/h2, as a minor/second major in uni, whether to take arts stream and what you want to pursue in the future. Do search up about the job prospects/demand too. All the best ❤"

Everyone watch this video NOW"
literature_tutor,1,"An arts stream certainly helps with your depth of understanding for the realm of humanities, even in terms of more philosophical themes (especially for lit). A good head start I would say! Of course, individual experience varies, some arts kids may know a lot less than some science kids in terms of humanities knowledge, and even in terms of skills, some science kids can write better than arts kids.

But in general, your decisions should be based on about  interests and future educational/career options: If your desired university and career paths are not STEM related at all, and you are sure about this, then an arts stream would be wonderful for you. So for your case, yes, go with arts! And not to mention, the different arts subs can help you build a more holistic picture about the human condition, humanities and social sciences.

And just to share a personal story, I came from science stream but was really interested in the arts/humanities and I ended up at NUS CHS and as my username suggests, I am also tutoring literature/gp now haha. Not to boast but I really found uni modules (at least for Lit) much easier for me because of my interest and my willingness to read secondary materials to polish my perspectives in the past actually proved to be a significant advantage for me in uni.

On the other hand science back in JC was pretty tough, Hwa Chong was pretty daunting but...  Lit and GP really helped me maintain my sanity and were my strongest subs even when spending lesser  time on them. So interest really helps you go a long way :) GO ARTS! haha :)"
Severe_County_5041,17,"if u r considering apply for american uni, the answer is yes, u should definitely take sat (even some say covid so test-optional, nah just take it anyway)

the exam takes place several times a year( usually every 2 to 3 months), u can go to the college board website to check their schedule
the exam is divided to english and math part. i would recommend u to search for some sample paper online to get a glimpse into the format because its quite different from all the singapore exams u might have taken. but to be brief, all are mcq, and math is simply primary-sec knowledge, very very basic. english pat gets some complex passages especially some of them are of those topics we are not usually familiar with, but i think its all mcq so doable ( after all english is kinda our native language so yeah a bonus for us)

bc u r j1 this year, u can definitely have a try first (if u r financially ok). it doesnt matter if u underperform for the first try bc in the end they will only ask for ur best scores ( u can try as many times as u want)

btw, now it's digital sat which means u will bring ur own laptop there. quite a new experience. good luck : )"
Quantum_Shade,10,"I took the SAT in 2019 and 2020 (subject tests in 2019, normal SAT in 2020), and scored a 1580 so I think I might able to answer some of your questions.

> is there some form the school will give? is it i have to apply on my own? and if it is when and where do i apply?

No, the school will not do anything. You will have to apply on your own. The website is [https://satsuite.collegeboard.org/sat/registration](https://satsuite.collegeboard.org/sat/registration) . Create a collegeboard account and follow the instructions. 

>also, do i need external help for sats? are the qns vastly different from A level syllabus? if it is shld i be attending external tuition for SATs?

Blunty speaking, their SATs are intended for our JC equivalents but their math is our P6 standard, and English is not much higher than Sec 4 standard. Their essay might take one or two practices getting used to and you should probably attempt some practices online (the collegeboard website will provide practices) to get used to the format and time management. Unless you are *really* behind and struggling in JC you should not need external tutiton to do well in SAT. 

As for the syllabus, it is much narrower in scope and much shallower than A-levels. 

>also, is it even worth the effort to do? will overseas unis even care if i did them or not? is doing it still useful if i do better for A levels than Sats ? 

The tricky part is that SATs are quite essential for US admissions, but worthless if you want to go to UK schools. Plus, as you can probably tell, the SATs are not that great of a differentiation tool for students when the questions are of that standard, so US schools also ask for a whole bunch of random shit beyond just SATs. Applying to US schools mostly revolve around the countless essays you have to write for each school that shows off how holistic, well-rounded and interesting you are, and is not something you can rush in one month.

>(since i probably wont put as much effort towards sats , unlikely that i get incredibly impressive grades la hor..)

I highly doubt you need to put a lot of effort towards SATs to get a score unless your foundations are really really REALLY weak. For me, I did one to two practice SATs a week for about a month prior to taking my SATs in March 2020. 

Hope this helps."
Relief-Old,3,"You might as well take the SAT, the test is not that hard (the math section is a joke), as long as you prepare a month advance for the reading section (for which you’d need to learn how to time manage and answer Qs) you’d be fine.

In poly, u have to be a lot more independent in ur own studies, with the fact that nursing is smth u might not like as much, u may not handle it well.

 Anyways  my point is, do what your heart tells you to do, don't go poly just because people say that ITE is a waste of time/stigma and regret it later..as well as ITE, it's okay to take a longer path as you're doing something you love.. afterall it's your life so do what you feel like you want to do and most importantly pls dont hace any regrets so atb op!! : )"
sagi271190,3,"From MOE's press release:

Expansion of Polytechnic Foundation Programme (PFP)

The PFP is a 1-year programme that presently offers eligible N(A) students a practice-based preparatory pathway to a polytechnic education. We will expand the PFP to allow for a wider profile of learners, offering a different combination of subjects at different subject levels, to access the PFP.

As announced at COS 2022, we will relax two 'B' subject grades to G2 Grade 4 or G3 E8 for admissions to PFP from the Academic Year (AY) 2024 intake to allow access for polytechnic-bound N(A) students who do reasonably well, but do not currently qualify for PFP.

From the AY2026 intake, admissions to the PFP will be restructured to a cluster-based approach. Students in the PFP will enter one of three key broad clusters: (i) Sciences (ii) Design, Engineering & Technology or (iii) Humanities, Art, Media and Business, before posting to a specific diploma course based on their interest and PFP performance.

From the AY2028 intake, we will also allow students taking G3 subjects, or a mix of G2 and G3 subjects to access PFP by mapping their G3 grade to the G2 equivalent – thus removing the current stream-based admission which is limited to today's N(A) students. Following this change, up to 2,600 students per AY are expected to be eligible for the PFP from AY2028, up from about 1,700 students per AY today.

thelegoknight100,151,"Ok. So what you going to do? Either you wake up and find ways to catch up such as asking for advice from your teacher mentors or you continue this mindset throughout JC. Unless you somehow can learn, understand and apply everything in a few days before exams, I suggest you find whatever is distracting you and try to put a stop to it. Talking to a counsellor might also help to understand what you are actually facing."
andrew_hihi,137,"People are recommending poly but with this attitude, I think Poly will even be more of a shit show because assignments will actually have deadlines and they might actually be graded. In JC, at least only A level matters. But that shouldn’t excuse one to not do work in JC.

PlasticTourist3025,12," JC was also a tight slap in the face for me bc I breezed thru much of secondary school and during my first irl physics lesson, I didn't understand anything at all and got 5/35 for my first TA (no joke lmao). JC really doesn't mess around and will make you realise how stupid you actually are.  For you I think you should rly ask your smarter friends/teachers immediately, to prevent snowballing.  Also yeah you should identify what is distracting you and eliminate that ASAP, and talk to your ft if you rly cannot cope.  It's not too late yet, you still have time to catch up. ATB

Edit: if your ft/teachers sense that you're facing something more than stress, they may refer to you a school counsellor (which may be more helpful to you)"
EdanyaGreen17,11,"i really get the inability to get yourself to walk to your studying area, prepare all the materials, focus for that period of time, and actually learn and remember what you studied.

honestly i also used to just look at the notes before exams then still manage to scrape by...

i'd suggest you break your studying process into really small steps, like trying to teach someone who's never studied how to study. 

you can prepare the materials that you want to study beforehand, so you won't have to grab them and get distracted by the things on your way to getting those materials. then if you get distracted by let's say the noises in environment, you can turn on some music (i play a music video on youtube and loop it so my brain gets used to it so i'm not very distracted by the song but i still don't end up focusing on the birds chirping)

maybe you could turn on one of those 'study with me' videos on youtube? i recently started studying this year, for once, and those videos helped me stay in the studying mood because i felt rude just going to surf internet when the video is playing

[lifeat.io](https://lifeat.io) might be helpful too as it's a website that provides different environments that play on your screen as a one giant collection of 'study with me' content. 

perhaps you could search up 'adhd study tips'? not trying to diagnose you with adhd but i personally think the tips for studying with adhd are helpful for me, and it wouldn't hurt to try!

i hope this helps (unlike the people just telling you that you've got potential and you should put in more effort since you manage to get into jc without studying... just try to study, even if it's in 15 minute blocks, it's still better than nothing :)"

resilientsingaporean,8,"Create a daily list by the hour of what you are gonna do immediately after your last lecture/tutorial ends each day. At the start of each week or at anytime along the week, write down your biggest weakness in each of your subjects and make the effort to go find it out by the end of each week. This is on top of whatever assignments and tasks handed out by your tutors.

You have to be organised in your daily schedules and make time and effort to find out in things that you don’t know or need to work on. Although you are only in the first half of J1, but I strongly encourage you to give my above method a try. Can pm me and I’ll explain it to you how to do it in detail, as there are conditions to ensure your daily scheduling is well executed.

Even as a working adult right now, I will still do my daily scheduling EVERY SINGLE DAY. 

If you fail to plan, you plan to fail.

That was the case for secondary school. But if you to avoid the same outcome for your promo exam and A lvl, it’s really time to take yr first step RIGHT NOW as what others have mentioned.

YOU_PASSED,2,"1. I was a Buddha foot-hugger. And let me tell you right now JC is all about developing that studying habit that works for you. You won’t be able to rely on last minute study to pull through. Find a study group. If you can’t find one, then form one. Have the habits of taking notes. Best if you can have a notebook for every subject. 

2. Talk to your profs for consultation. They are more than happy to help, unless it’s last minute consultation. Don’t be shy and try to ask questions in class. Don’t leave the class with unanswered questions.

3. Don’t spend too much time on your CCA. No one is going to give two hoots about your CCA achievements if you score poorly for A levels.

This is Singapore. If u don't want to study, don't think you can through post-secondary education, and uni is way out of the question. I'm not trying to be mean, but that's just how it is in this country. 

An A-level cert is pretty much useless if you're not going to uni, and since you aren't willing to put in the effort to study, I recommend you drop out now and apply to any job that accepts applicants that only have an O-level cert. 

Don't think poly will be easier, it's even more self-directed, and almost every assignment is graded and has deadlines. So if you're adamant to be lazy and not forcing yourself to study, start working right now and save money. If you're a guy, enter NS and sign on. Your pay won't be high because of your low qualifications, but it's better than wasting ur time in school when you don't even bother to try."

Bookworm_1997,1,"Okay tbh I hated studying in JC. Not because I didn't like the subjects but I hated the emphasis on exams/A levels. However, that is really the point of JC - to get u an express ticket to Uni. 

You could do 2 things: 

1) Find your interest/passion (outside academics) and work your butt off on it. It may pay off and perhaps, studying or doing A levels/getting to Uni becomes a back- up plan. Not sure what your parents will think of this, but let's not go there first. 

2) If you have no said passion, try your best to do at least decently well. A levels cert on its own is super useless and if u end up having to repeat or go to poly, u are wasting time studying when you already don't like to. It's like prolonging torture. 

I'm not gonna preach to you about the importance of JC or Uni because having done it all, I'm very jaded about their purpose. But what I've learnt from all this is that it is very important to know and understand yourself. That will take you in the path you would excel in. Do whatever but at the end, know why you are doing it. And take all the consequences in your stride. 

Sry for the long post"

Seems like you managed to get this far just on sheer luck or you are one of those 'no need study still can pass' type. It may or may not last you until A levels, and from your post, it seems like your reliance on natural intelligence has caught up with you. 

Realise that Sg society still heavily education and academic certification based, not like other countries where your chances of starting a business and succeeding are actually more possible."

JC is the most demanding and toughest part of our education system. Well, many from JC will be future leaders of our organisations (pte and gov) and country. Hence, the training here. 

JC work is certainly way tougher than O level. You can’t do things like in secondary sch. No point hoping for O level conditions n environment to happen. It won’t. Is just like one wants to hv primary sch life when one is in sec 1. Is just not possible; you hv grown up.

Review your capabilities and wants. Make a decision and work on it. The longer you drag on your decision, the less options you have. The earlier you mak a decision, the more time you hv for your study. 

Imagine your peers racing to the A level finishing line and you still walking and pondering whether to do so or not. Another batch racing to poly finishing line and you still undecided to race with them or not. When both batches reached the finishing lines, u r still nowhere.

Doing homework can help yourself, and if the teachers need to grade, better to do, set up a timetable. If teacher not collecting, don't need to do, just check answers, if dk how answers, then ask teacher or classmates.

Don't spend too much time hating the chers, they bare minimum doing their job.

Goodluck. If JC is bad for you, don't even think about coming to university for stem, lmao, very much more intense. Focus on what you love to do e.g. if you can like to code, then can try starting with it. If you like music then do that, if you like art, then do that.

Khainesg,8,"As a father of 2 whom both just go into JC (for 1) and Poly PFP (for the other), I do think you mother is putting too much stress on both you and your brother which is extremely unhealthy. For myself, long time back, after my Os, I didn't go to Poly (there were only SP, NP only) nor did I go to JC. Why? Cos I knew that time I wanted to do something in IT and they were not available then. So, off to private school I went, finished up with a Higher Diploma in IT from TMC (not sure if they are still around) and I was extremely fortunate that my parents were able to pay for me to go Curtin Uni in Perth to do my degree.

Nowadays, there are so many pathways. Going to JC or Poly are both viable routes. At the end of the day, employers look at your diploma/degree, together with your attitude. Even with diploma, there are so many private unis in SG that you can get your degree locally (although it will cost more).

As for your mother, have you raise up your thoughts and fears to your FATHER? You got to share what you feel to your parents. We are not mind-readers :P However, in the worst case scenario, I suggest you go approach a third party counseling service (ie Touch Community) for help or even just go to IMH (they have an emergency counter or call their Child Guidance Centre for help), and get them to talk to your mother.

Ur o level cert is just that, a piece of paper. It does not define ur entire life.

1) Make a list of what you are good at and what your strengths are. Make another post with this list and ask for recommendations. You need to put in the effort and hours on your end to identify who you are too

2) Eliminate all courses you know you are not interested in

3) Make a list of potential courses that are left. Go to each university's website, look through their course catalogue/student handbook

4) Youtube ""Day in the life of a xxx student"" or ""Day in the life of a xxx job"" and watch, see if that interests you

I will also say that what you study is starting to be a lot less relevant for your future job. So I would suggest figuring out what you are at least somewhat interested in and choosing based on that"

Dxnaa,9,"Female, retook last year

1. scored about 73 but I wanted to enter medicine so I retook as priv candidate.

2. I had a work contract early on so I really started studying around May and full on focused from Sept since BMAT was coming as well.

3. I simply looked at my poly friends who are schooling lmao. Honestly it’s a privilege to only have to school 2 years. Once you enter uni you’ll understand that freshmen can be of all ages even up to 24. I didnt have any friends who were private candidates like me so I made 1-2 friends online (can be priv candidate/J3/J2) to study with. Imo tuition also helps keep you sane cause that’s the only time you can communicate with others. I also have a belief where I’d rather take an alternate route than to enter a course i know i wouldn’t like just because everyone else does so.

4.  I didn’t achieve my desired rp by a grade but i’m still rather satisfied. I also feel that it’s worth retaking as a priv candidate. Even if you don’t get your desired grades but your grades are good enough, it’s fine. Plus an extra year can help you gain way more experience and also serves as a “vacation” from school (tho i really miss school now hahah :’) )"

Trust me, no one understands right after lectures and it’s normal. You prob just need to finish a round of tutorial to be able to actually learn something.

for atomic structure for eg, take note for the answering techniques for trends (ionisation energy down a group etc), and most importantly the exceptions! the qns are basically standard 90% of the time, free marks essentially!!

Embarrassed-Swan6434,2,"Never had trouble w chem nor phy, but I did have some experience playing catch up w math and econs for more than half a year’s worth of content in y2 which was both emotionally and physically stressful af.

So u prolly need to get a good grasp of the content first, rewatch the lectures if possible (during the covid period they were online), multiple times if needed. Then u need to take time to understand the notes, can annotate and ask ppl if there are things u don’t understand. Lastly u got to apply it in the tutorial. For math my revision plan was to redo different types of tutorial questions (I have done them 3 times on different occasions alr cos of my forgetting curve lol) then I moved on to the extra practice q and after y2 mid years I started on the past year and other sch papers. For econs I really cmi so I joined a study group who were better at econs and they motivated me to do papers, shared their answers and helped to explain many concepts. 

Tbh it’s not healthy to procrastinate till u reach my situation back then as catching up was nearly impossible due to having to juggle new content that was coming in as well .~. Srsly gained a lot of weight and slept like 6 hours or less consistently during that period, and still get huanted by nightmares of this occasionally. As such you gotta start grinding abit to clear whatever topics u are lagging on. For the zoning out during lectures what u might want to do is to pre read the topic abit, tho I have not done that previously and hence maybe that’s why I zoned out too. Anyways atb in your revision and use the hols wisely :)

If you do a JD where would you do it? Your law programme would matter more if youre going for magic circle firms

That being said. Id go overseas. Theres a lot that can change in 4 years. And trust me - learning to be independent and survive on your own is a skill that cannot be replaced. 

If you work hard enough to be THAT good - you will get a good job regardless of overseas or local. You can always learn more to break into a better job. You can never replace your undergrad experience. Its not like your offer is a bad one

PlasticTourist3025,13,"My question is: why did you not inform your teacher immediately *once* you realised that the ws was due the next day and you couldn't do it? She may not read it asap but at least you don't turn up to class telling her that you have nothing to hand in.
Edit: you made it appear like you felt no urgency about the situation, and that you didn't seem to preempt your teacher's response which would most likely be negative

Yes, the whole situation is quite unfortunate but imo its immature to hold a grudge against your teacher when you failed to take responsibility.  If your friend doesn't have a phone, couldn't you email him instead/text him on Google hangouts? Does he have a home number/parents number for you to call?

Your teacher's response may not be the most ideal to you, but what she said is true, you're a young adult now and you need to take full responsibility for everything you do in school and in life.  I think her response is justified and she has every right to be angry, and even so, I think her response was pretty appropriate and gracious because it's not her job to spoonfeed and baby you after you messed up.  In the future, the workplace environment is going to be harsher than this.

Could it be that your personal statement was the weak link in your application?

pratamark,5,"So many people want to talk about portfolio and what not, but RP is still king in Singapore. 

Honestly if you pick the sports CCA and you hate it, and you don’t like playing the sport, you will feel the strain it has on you. Additionally if you don’t like the CCA in the first place, my guess is you probably would not take up an EXCO position, which probably hurts your “portfolio” even more. Honestly go for the CCA you want to participate in and if you are so worried about portfolio I would suggest taking up an EXCO position in a CCA you enjoy. 

If you want to stand out in forensics or science eventually when you apply, go for internships or things related to the field. That adds way more credibility and value to your application, go participate in competitions and participate in events related to that field. I highly doubt sports CCA would make that much of a difference compared to guitar. 

Everyone struggles when they start JC, it’s not a good representation of your ability. Eventually you will get the rhythm of it and everything will work out. All the best"
DeepestBag33,14,"It's possible to study when sick, but it depends on the severity of the illness and how it affects you.  
If you have a mild cold or headache, you may be able to study as long as you take breaks when you need to and prioritize rest and self-care. However, if you have a more serious illness, such as the flu or a high fever, it's important to prioritize rest and recovery over studying. Pushing yourself too hard can prolong your illness and make it harder for your body to heal.  
It's also important to consider how your illness may affect your ability to concentrate and retain information. If you're feeling too sick or fatigued to focus, it may be better to take a break from studying until you feel better.  


In general, it's important to listen to your body and prioritize rest and self-care when you're sick. Taking care of yourself is key to a speedy recovery and getting back to your studies in a healthy and productive way."
genotypes,7,"I would pick part time local degree if I were you, as it would be more recognised compared to private degree. Private universities would be a really last resort imo.

As for the requirements I think as long as you are 21 years old and above, and already have 2 years of full-time working experience OR you are currently employed, you are eligible to apply for PT SUSS. They will not kick you out if you are unemployed, as long as you already fulfil the 2 years full-time work experience requirement."
GloxyVI,2,">As the title suggest, is a part time local degree or full time private degree more helpful in getting a job after graduation or are they the same?

They are sadly not the same. Will reply under assumption it's NUS/NTU/SMU. Both will give off different signalling effects. Private means I can lowball you because likely others will too (sad reality) and for bigger companies with highly competitive job your resume will be thrown in the bin before it reaches human eyes.

> I know a full time local degree is definitely the best option but I would like to have a backup plan because I dont have a relevant diploma and my gpa isnt the best either.

It would be more beneficial if you could do it fulltime to get your GPA up. If you got trash GPA, it's also not a very good signal. 

>Also will I be kicked out of the part time course if I suddenly quit my full time job after semester starts or as long as I am employed full time when school starts it will be fine? Any advice is appreciated, thanks.

- although your portfolio may not be directly related to linguistics, as long as you can link it to it, it should still be okay (eg. noticing that people at the pharmacy had different speech patterns or something, idk man, need to bs). i heard that the profs are looking for people who are really interested in the subject, hence the need for interviews for LMS. try your best to show your enthusiasm for the subject.

avandleather,33,"It is only a waste of time if you deem it to be.

However, reality and the nature of how this country is run dictates that STEM and finance-related degrees command higher pay. Most graduates end up working in roles completely unrelated to their major, either through intensive networking or picking up in-demand skills."
avocadohater3000,27,"My friend had no trouble finding work as an English Lit grad BUT he was from Yale-NUS so the brand name might have helped. But beyond that, he made it a point to do many internships throughout his 4 years and eventually landed a job in management consulting at the end of his schooling. 

So it is possible to venture into more Business-y career options, but you gotta hunt for those internships. You must also get FCH, nothing less, and make sure you stand out from other Biz applicants.

You can decide for yourself if it's worth it to put in the extra work by pursuing your passion."
feyeraband,27,"Honestly, it doesn’t matter. Unless it’s a STEM job, all other jobs are up for grabs no matter what your major is. 

Truth is, for non-STEM, your major ends up teaching you things your work will never use. I’ve seen an English lit masters beat out pol sci majors for defence policy jobs. I’ve seen philosophy grads beat IR majors for foreign affairs and even banking. 

Lots of humans grads also end up in consultancy too. It’s more about how you think rather than what you know. 

Your first class honours, internship and knowledge of the industry’s scope are what matters. The first is better accomplished in a major that you like. The second depends on your interview skills and your personality to some degree (all interns are equally useless/useful to the company in the end). And the third can really be learnt through google and just knowing general shit about the world. 

Most people I’ve seen that fail to get the jobs they want despite a stellar undergrad record fail because of the third part. They just go into an interview or application thinking that they can rely solely on their degree knowledge. Or their knowledge of the world ends wherever the assigned readings end. This is especially common for Singaporeans who just like to follow the book. But it happens in every major; biz, lit, soci etc."
chloekwy,18,honestly both communications and sociology are 'arts' degrees as well so the prospects wouldn't be that much better than literature; you can refer to the latest GES which shows starting salaries for lit/comms/socio to be more or less similar. i agree with the other commenter that you can do a double major/degree including lit.
hengkaki,5,"Do Biz Ad if you can get in and are also somewhat numerically inclined. This will give you the widest leeway in the choice of career.

Eng lit is too narrow and is good if you plan to teach. Same for sociology (narrow). If I am hiring for say HR, betw a degree holder and non degree holder, I wd choose the degree holder even if the degree is not relevant. I wd be hiring more for the candidate's ability to think and analyse critically (hopefully developed from their uni education).

But betw 2 degree holders, I wd prefer one with a biz ad degree. In today's context HR needs to understand business in order to support it. It is also possible to hire non biz ad candidates, it's just that the learning curve is a little bit steeper.

But bottom line, the candidate with good work ethics, is able to think and analyse, a problem solver and a team player will always be the preferred one."

bigoof568,2,"hi, i looked at the chs website and it says that the prerequisite to take Physics in NUS is H2 Mathematics. does that mean that i dont need H2 Physics to take Physics as a major?"
FuelUsed488,2,"Hi, how different is uni physics from h3 physics? What are the types of math needed in physics, ie ODE,PDE,linear algebra, multivariable calculis…"
FuelUsed488,2,"Personally, I am interested in physics major for the following reasons:

1 a strong interest in the subject since secondary school, it is intellectually rewarding to visualise phenomenas and making sense of the concepts, rather than just getting the answers by applying formulas and regurgitacting a fixed algorithm to solve problems, I tend to ponder and ask why some concepts are the way they are. Overall, I’m very inquisitive.

&#x200B;

2. had a strong foundation and aptitude for this subject since secondary school, came in top in h2 physics in jc, and honorable mentions for physics olympiads in JC.

&#x200B;

3. following the second reason, since I was quite good in physics at jc level as the math in just algebraic manipulation and computation , I often found physics to be too easy to make me satisfied, and want to have a more intellectually challenging level in the subject.

&#x200B;

4  JC physics could cover only so much, things like maxwell laws, shrodinger wave equation, angular momentum and gyroscopes, 2nd and 3rd laws of thermodynamics, basics of fluid dynamics were not covered. Felt that h2 physics was just not enough."
deepsapphites,1,"first of all, this will be long and meander-y so i apologise if it's disorganised and doesn't make sense. also disclaimer that i believe ultimately this is a decision only you can make and i don't have a stance on what you should do; this is simply to help you rationalise (and hopefully not make you even more confused LOL)

long story short, in upper sec and jc i struggled big-time and when i got into a uni course that i liked, i thought ""cool beans, now that i'm doing something i like things will get better"". turns out it didn't. i had a smooth enough time in years 1&2, but after that i started struggling again. the problem is that the *root causes* (personally it was some psychological problems) for why i was struggling were never resolved, and sometimes interest is not enough to tide you through if you don't address the root of why exactly you're struggling.

so my first piece of advice is that you have to examine what exactly is the root cause for why you are struggling. has your health (physical & mental) been all right lately? are you putting unnecessary pressure on yourself, thus sapping your love for your course? are you unfairly comparing yourself to other people? because depending on what the root of it is, changing courses may not resolve what you're going through.

something else we can consider is that interest can be an interesting topic (haha). sometimes the things we like are the things that cause us the most grief. i'm an english major who hates writing bc every word i submit has to be perfect, but when i do produce something i'm happy with, it's so satisfying. you mentioned things like

>I chose this specialisation because I thought it was a meaningful challenge/industry to be in and the theoretical problems always attracted me but I am very slow to think thru the solutions  
>  
>Other areas I didn't expect to like became more manageable than what I chose smh...

which sound like maybe you're struggling with measuring up to your expectations of something you like and care about. do you think this is something you could address? or do you think a course that you don't feel so strongly about would be better? also consider if your interest in this course is better off explored in short spans rather than prolonged over years of uni requiring constant work.

let's consider changing courses as well. i know it sounds like i don't place much emphasis on interests, but really there has to be a minimum level of interest & curiosity in whatever you choose to do, bc when you're struggling (as you likely will bc uni) you'll have to be able to answer what the meaning & endgame for your pain is. also, there is this problem where you can never really tell what something really is like until you're doing it yourself. i'm not sure how much time you've spent on classes from this alternative course but chances are it's not representative of how it might feel to really do it full-time. get a thorough understanding of what students studying that course think & feel about it. also compare its curriculum, assessment methods & overall teaching/learning style to what you're doing now. consider how you would deal with this new course, with your aptitude, mental state and learning habits etc.

i know this sounds like i don't encourage you changing courses, which is not the case! i'm simply concerned bc it sounds like you are still relatively passionate about your course which is something that will encourage you on bad days in a way that a course you're meh about cannot. ultimately, i think it's most important that you identify the root cause of this trouble and address it from there. whatever you choose, i wish you the best and believe in a few years you will look back on the you now knowing you did the best you could!"
DeepestBag33,2,"Student council mentors and teachers typically look for certain qualities and characteristics in students who they believe would make good student council members. Some of these qualities may include:  
  
Leadership skills: Student council members are expected to be leaders and role models for their peers, so mentors and teachers often look for students who demonstrate strong leadership skills. This might include qualities such as being proactive, responsible, confident, and assertive.  
  
Communication skills: Effective communication is key to being a successful student council member, so mentors and teachers may look for students who are able to express themselves clearly and persuasively both in writing and in speaking.  
  
Teamwork and collaboration: Student council members work closely with one another and with school administration, so mentors and teachers often look for students who are able to work well in a team and collaborate effectively with others.  
  
Initiative and creativity: Student council members are often responsible for planning and executing events and initiatives, so mentors and teachers may look for students who are creative and able to think outside the box.

Is it easy no? was it easier for me yes cuz i took engineering so all the math i already learn pretty well. hows my gpa? around 3.0 also so its all good. 

What did i do? I had tuition for math and physics. MT im able to study on my own. I barely studied for econs hence the D but its doable. im pretty sure if i got more time can do better so probably gonna retake HAHA. Do not take chemistry though as you def need to do experiements for that. I spent as much as 4 hours or daily studying math( i like doing math its kinda fun) and around 1 to 2 on physics. on the weekends i would study GP and econs. Never studied MT cuz 1st language."

sendmebackintimepls,4,"friend, i admire your determination. but please, similar to other comments don’t try and juggle both diploma and As. there’s a reason for having two separate institutions to do either. A levels is tough plain and simple. a lot of studying and tuition is required if you want to do really well. Money wise is also taxing obviously. And at the A levels it is no where similar to Os. A totally huge jump. A levels require you to not only understand what you know but to use it and apply it in different contexts, a lot of evaluation and analysis. You can’t simply memorise and regurgitate. However this depends on what stream you take; sci/arts/commerce.
In summation I’d highly recommended you to get your Diploma done then consider your options afterwards. If you feel A levels is what you’re gunning for, then go because if you do well (69 RP >) then you’d have a higher chance of entering local U. As of now, read up the syllabus guide on potential subjects you’d take if you’re gonna seat for the As. It is a tough but rewarding journey my friend. you’re 20, that’s fine. There are people I know a lot older doing As. Age doesn’t matter. what matters is you putting in the effort and determination to get it done right and well. All the best my friend."

cai_tao_kueh,1,"I'm assuming you're talking about english oral, because hcl oral also has this format.

for english oral, try to grasp the main ideas of the video. some people can write an entire script in 10 mins because their writing is just too fast. for you, just write down the important points that will need for your main points during the oral. after that, describe the scene that you watched in the video and develop your points (why would it benefit/not benefit the target audience? does it answer the question?) it helps if you can process your thoughts quicker :) once you give out your points, try to explain why others might oppose your view. 

""However, I do understand why some people would (agree/disagree with my view) because...explain why they may not like it and what would be more feasible/enjoyable for them.

for spoken interaction, honestly it's damn hard to score and I feel you. however, you can try to guess the questions based on the videos you watched. one of the common questions are, ""Would you parents/grandparents/friends/siblings agree to your view of (main topic)?"" try to answer the question with your own personal experience, and try not to lie. the examiners will deduct marks from you when you try to lie. they will just interrogate you with questions till the point you turn sian

for second qn, it's usually an argumentative sort of question. same thing as what you have learnt in school. give two arguments, counter argument, followed by a rebuttal. try to start the topic with a specific group of people, then broaden. eg. how will it affect me? how will it affect my family? how will it affect my school? how will it affect my country? how will it affect the world? it helps you to think more efficiently and allows you to have a well organised structure.

lastly, practice makes perfect. ask your friends to test you every once in a while, try not to stutter if possible and ensure you get all the key points right.

all the best OP!"

GloxyVI,6,">I have started to form a deep hatred with what I am doing here and I can't stand the feeling of being lost and not sure on what to do all the time.

Think about doing what you are doing, but for the next 20-30 years of your life. If you already hate coding & math now, then I don't see why you should continue.

>I feel that you minimally need A maths to do well in this course. 

You referring to calc? Yeah you will need that and also multivariable calculus for gradient descent if you are aiming to touch ML.  


> I feel that from the first day I started this the course I was already so far behind. Now I feel like I just cant catch up because of how fast they are progressing through the topics.

Either you need a gap semester to study your math notations + beef up your content or you need to change course. If things start to snowball you could be failing exams pretty soon once you hit the tougher topics

>Now I am stuck, should I stay and suffer despite getting borderline passes for all my modules, somehow graduate (if i can) and get $4.5k+ salary (according to stats) or do I transfer to a different course that is business related, something I have experience in, have interest in (risk getting lower pay and make my parents mad)?

I'd recommend you transfer. No point staying and struggling with content or even failing exams. If you fail your mods in let's say Y3 and can't get back up, then you wasted most of your years already.

To be frank, if you can't code well, I don't see how you are going to get the $4.5k anyhow. That seems abit too optimistic. Tech jobs are extremely competitive with the shap increase of NUS CS and other majors now taking CS mods to do a career swtich. Same with me, EEE, Phy,Biz, Law most I know in my generation have made the switch. The competition is only going to go up and not down. 

My tip would be to switch to a major you like and get damn good at it. You can get back that $4.5k pay.

NUS PFM shows that our 75th percentile is only $3.7k, but what it doesn't show is that the top few from NUS PFM/IPM are drawing a TC of $5k-5.5k a month out of graduation because they are one of the good ones."
hengkaki,3,"For your own sake, do the transfer. 

If you fail to make the grade for RTIS (which seems likely based on what you wrote), you will not only miss any RTIS opportunity, you will miss the opportunity you could have had with the business-related degree."
hyena-,2,"I'm in your cohort and am from a completely different background (design course) as well.

I took a gap year before deciding that this was the correct route for me and I came in with limited self-taught knowledge of everything. But I am doing well to OK for everything, this is not to shoot you down, but take a step back, and really relook at what you really want to pursue.

Seeing our peers around us, there are people with computing backgrounds but no interest doing horribly, but also a lot of people with zero background managing and some doing well.

You have to find and decide on your passion. If you really feel this is not meant for you, a transfer might be good, but the grass always seems greener on the other side.

If you want to try to continue, there are resources around that you aren't making use of, ASC is available everyday, and most (ya know who the shitty one is) of our profs and lecturers are friendly and respond to any queries on teams (even late at night) or for direct consultation. Maths especially, so far, all our profs are super friendly and willing to even set up direct 1:1 consultation sessions if you ask."
geniusinvocator,2,"Hello, year 3 RTIS student here. It really depends on how badly you want this. I myself have 0 programming knowledge & only EMath when I enrolled and I would say I am still doing fairly well (hopefully this will inspire you). 

Grass is always greener on the other side. You really have to ask yourself HOW MUCH you want this and WHY. Why did u hate what you are doing? Are you being too reliant on others (chatgpt included) spoonfeeding you? How much effort have you really put in to learn? Have you really went the extra mile to improve (watch videos on what you dont know when you commute, physically find seniors, pester your professors, make friends and study with people smarter than you, etc (i did all these because I am hungry to get better)). You really have to be honest with yourself.

You definitely need to change some things if you are already struggling with what you have right now as you are in for a treat with CUDA and Low Level Programming (considered rtis toughest) modules being lined up next, and with Mobile&Cloud + GAM + ML + VR projects happening simultaneously for year 3 trimester 2 (you really need to have good time management here).

quek3,1,"Private tutor here for several years:

For the first few years, since we have little experience and a very small client base, I sucked it up and tend to accept less favourable (but acceptable) conditions for my tutees (such as distance, inconvenience etc). I work hard to make a good impression, deliver grades and help students with their questions over WhatsApp. It wasn’t that easy as travelling took up a lot of time, but I pressed on.

Fast forward a few years later, I’ve built a strong client base. Recommendations pour in every now and then, especially the start of the year (when the new school term starts) and the middle of the year (when students realised they can’t keep up). Clients are willing to pay me much higher (up to twice my rate years ago). And I do not have to rely on tuition agencies anymore. I also take up less tutees now, so I have more free time but still earning roughly the same.

Honestly, the tuition agencies are also looking to maximise profit and customer satisfaction. It’s also obvious that the parent/client base is much larger than the tutor base, so they will try to satisfy the parents more than the tutor. Can’t really blame them for being profit-driven. 

Nevertheless, jiayou and good luck in finding your next client! 

Extra info: I’m effectively bilingual and can teach academic subjects in Mandarin completely. It was a good selling point for my PRC clients. Nevertheless, I believe parents/clients are willing to engage you and recommend you if you work hard in your first few years! The word of mouth is very powerful!"

However, it was not unfairly graded, you just didn't study right. Sure. Your situation was absolutely dreadful, but saying it's unfairly graded is a bit childish.
It's quite obvious that the o levels are most likely going to be more difficult than prelims, so just because you put the effort you put in for prelims to get C6 doesn't mean you putting that same amount of effort guarantees the same for O level. Instead, you should be putting in even more effort to at least get a C6

0racion_Seis,11,"Ello!! First, I want to congratulate you for completing the SG A Levels because it is not easy. For context, I completed my SG A Levels in 2020, but only scored 65rp or CCD for my H2 subjects. Regardless of what my parents and peers told me, going poly or private degree, I decided to venture into taking the UK A Levels (Cambridge). Trust me when I say NOT to take the UK A Levels lightly just because you have done the 'harder' version of A Levels under the Singapore exam board.

In SG A Level, I took 3H2 subjects - Physics, Chemistry, and Mathematics, and got DCC in that order. However, for UK A Level (Cambridge), I took Physics, Chemistry, Geography, and Mathematics, and got A\*A\*A\*A in that order.

Now another thing to note is that the SG A Level H1 subjects are equivalent to the UK AS Level subjects, while SG A Level H2 subjects are equivalent to the UK A Level subjects. (We often call UK A Level subjects as 'A2' Level subjects to make it clearer). So please be careful when choosing your subjects.

&#x200B;

Also, DO NOT take AS Level subjects as universities will not accept them. Universities only accept the full A Level subjects. Oh, General Paper is NOT accepted as a way to demonstrate your English Language abilities because it is NOT a language subject. You will have to sit for the IELTS to prove your English Language Proficiency because our SG O Level English Language is not widely accepted by many UK universities. Some do allow, but always check with the universities first!!

&#x200B;

On to your questions:

Q1) Now I don't recommend taking Edexcel IAL because of the following condition that you MUST meet to score A\*. This does not exist for Cambridge International Examination (CIE).

""To score an A\* in an Edexcel International A level you must:

get an A grade for your overall International Advanced Level. produce a high level performance at International A2 - scoring at least 90% of the A2 UMS marks.""

Source: [https://qualifications.pearson.com/en/support/support-topics/results-certification/understanding-marks-and-grades/understanding-your-results-information-for-students/edexcel-international-advanced-level-results-explained.html#:\~:text=To%20score%20an%20A\*%20in,of%20the%20A2%20UMS%20marks](https://qualifications.pearson.com/en/support/support-topics/results-certification/understanding-marks-and-grades/understanding-your-results-information-for-students/edexcel-international-advanced-level-results-explained.html#:~:text=To%20score%20an%20A*%20in,of%20the%20A2%20UMS%20marks).

I will be speaking solely on CIE Syllabus for some of the subjects.

Now, I'm not sure what subjects you took for your A Levels, but assuming you take the sciences (Physics/Chem/Bio), most of the content required for the UK A Level Science subjects would have already been covered by SG. However, as the UK science subjects tend to cover a wider breadth compared to SG science subjects, there are still some topics you may need to cover on your own. For instance, in SG H2 Chemistry, we do not learn the 'addition-elimination' mechanism for organic chemistry, and we also do not learn 'Analytical techniques': Thin-layer chromatography & Gas /liquid chromatography. But you will have to study them for the UK A Level Chemistry syllabus. (Note that this is just 1 example, there are quite a few topics that I did not list here) But in terms of sciences, Chemistry would be the subject that has the least to catch up on, assuming you had already done H2 Chemistry.

&#x200B;

However, for UK A Level Mathematics. It's quite different from SG A Level, in the sense that we can choose '2 different pathways' to sit for. The 1st pathway is where you take 'Pure Math 1', 'Pure Math 3', 'Mechanics', and 'Probability & Statistics 1'. The 2nd pathway is where you take 'Pure Math 1', 'Pure Math 3', 'Probability & Statistics 1', and 'Probability & Statistics 2'. I personally took the 1st pathway because SG H2 Math did not cover certain topics under 'Probability & Statistics 2', such as 'The Poisson distribution'. But regardless of which path you undertake, both will give you the same recognition that you have completed the UK A Level Mathematics subject.

&#x200B;

For Humanities subjects like Geography & History. , It's almost a different game altogether. You will now have to learn 'case studies' where you really have to go really in-depth and be very specific about the laws/incentives/regulations of the country that you are discussing when answering certain questions. For instance, when talking about sustainable management in the tropics in geography. I used the example of Brazil, and literally, aside from my points and evaluation, a lot of content was talking about the specifics of that country. (Idk if SG do this but from my experience, I did not do this at all).

Q2) So for CIE, there are 2 exam seasons in a year. May/June & Oct/Nov Series. Although it is primarily offered at British Council Singapore (Napier Road), other institutions such as SSTC also accept private candidates. For Edexcel, they call their exam sessions 'Summer' and 'Winter', which corresponds to May/June & Jan respectively. The only institution I know that accepts private candidates for Edexcel is British Council Singapore (Napier Road). There might be others, but I'm not so sure!!

&#x200B;

Q3) Yes, for CIE, there are practical exams. Now, please note the difference between 'practical exams' & 'practical theory exams'. They are different. 'Practical exams' are the ones where you have to conduct your own experiment and collect your own data. After which, you will answer some questions based on your OWN findings. 'Practical theory exams' are purely on writing, which means that all the data has already been given in the question and you will just need to analyse them to answer the questions. Oh, and these 'practical theory exams' will have a planning component to them as well.

For Edexcel, you will only have 'practical theory exams'. You will not be required to conduct your own experiments at all.

&#x200B;

Q4) Most UK universities only look for your best 3 A Level grades, with the exception of certain institutions. As for Australia, it really depends on the course and institution you are applying to, so it's really hard to advise. One thing to note for UK universities is that you will apply through the UCAS system, where you can only apply to 5 universities each year. UK universities assess you holistically, which means that you WILL have to write a personal statement & get 1 reference letter from someone who can vouch for you. Most UK universities also access if you have passed your O Level equivalent of English Language & Mathematics, with some universities requiring more than just a 'C' grade in both these subjects. Some universities even require you to have X number of passes at O Levels, or even a pass in specific subjects at O Levels. So please make sure you know the requirements of every university you are applying to. More often than not, if you did not pass the subject at O Level on your 1st try, most universities accept re-takes.

I think for me I will discourage looking for a tutor if you are mainly a Humanities student. In fact, you will find it a lot more affordable if you can self-study, and you may occasionally seek help from your alma mater ie. contact ur JC teachers and ask for feedback. I myself had to leave JC due to family circumstances in my year, and my JC teachers extended the offer to provide help should I request it. I think some teachers can be very kind.

Remember: by now, you are a full-fledged adult and should have the discipline and willpower to put in the effort necessary to self-study, especially since you decided you want to take A Levels as a private candidate. It will be a lot of effort, but it all boils down to your own resolve.

Hope this helps."

If it's hard for you to read the textbook, then get one of those guidebooks from Popular cuz I think they're easier to read and understand. Go for consult if you really dunno how to do sbq but seq should be fine if you have contextual knowledge. Maybe your school's A math questions are different from the practices? A math should be fine as long as you understand the concepts and can do the tys. Most of the stuff is the same just with different numbers. Anyways, if you're studying more than 3 hours a day, you've got the spirit!! That's great effort 👍👍school exams are never an accurate representation of your real potential because they are very different from Os. Os are much easier.

Sounds like you need exposure therapy. Keep under-going mock exams until your mind doesn't go blank.

>I study at least 3 hours a day and even watch online videos on study techniques and tips

Time doesn't matter. It's the quality and alot of other factors as well:

1. Diet. Eating good brain foods
2. Exercise to keep your blood pumping and mind clear
3. Environment. If you need a quiet place to study.
4. Sleep. Sleep well. You stress = nothing will go through.
5. Genetics. Sadly this plays a huge part. If you optimize for everything and I mean everything, then the only thing holding you back is just genetics. Either due to slow maturity or capacity for understanding & recalling facts quickly. (iirc the reason most PSLE top scorers were girls was because girls matured faster.)

Point #5 can't be fixed sadly. You just have to watch it play out if your S-curve goes exponential in your later years. Hence you see super-star families where everyone was a Lawyer/Doctor/Biz or Comp Sci (today) fella. If you went to RI, you throw a few stones and you will definitely hit someone who came from such a family.

Some of the commenters here pm-ed me in private because they were from said super-star families. Being born in one also has it's cons, you have big shoes to fill.

>My parents constantly scolded me for my shitty grades and accused me of doing things I don't even do.

That's just bad parenting. Even for my kid I don't give pressure on grades. If he get then get lor? Don't get then don't get lor? 

Parents sadly have a belief that they can control their children's destiny. Which is false.

Don't fret too much. Just do your best and see what comes of it. If you've done everything you can then there was nothing else that could be done."

or 2) you don't know your stuff well enough 

how to find out if you dont alr know? try doing stuff under timed condition, get a friend to stress you out. Try a practice paper w a friend there to like ""invigilate"". Maybe study w them and then they let u know when times up or smt, or yall do a paper tgt at the same time.

and then try to do without timed condition. 

if its 1) , you have to try to overcome it. practice under timed condition more. give urself less time,  even

2) might have to review your study methods. maybe your study method is inefficient / not suited for that specific subject? e.g. you simply read and reread notes to memorise. TYS is goated btw HAHAHAH but im from a different time, dk if its useful now.

applebottomjeansbott,1,"hii op! i took Os last year got distinctions for ae maths and trip sci so i think im able to dish out some advice LOL 

emath & amath: practice. literally js practice. my teacher gives the class a quiz after every topic and to revise, for the quiz i didnt do well in i redo them and see whether i have learnt frm my mistakes. and if u feel tht oh, its v tedious to do sm qns. yes i feel the same way, so what can we do abt it? we mentally solve it. look at a qn and process your thoughs. what steps wld i take to solve the qn? look at the answer key, ok thought process same, move on to the next qn and repeat. once u reach a qn u feel that u have to do (mayb a more diff qn) thn u do yk so u get to do many diff qns mentally and yeah tht rlly works. also memorise formulas, thts rlly basic. tag qns u got wrong and r v important. look thru these tagged pages once again before exam 

bio: 
i watch yt vids online and honestly i have a really deep interest for bio. instead of plainly memorising, understand why a process happens. seriously understand. i see my friends rushing to to memorise keywords and content before exams and i never needed to do so bc yk understand n rlly pay attention in class la. if dk anything js b annoying and stop the teacher frm leaving the class until u clarified al ur doubts, if too many doubts go consult bro dont scared teachers r super super nice

But do note that finance major is v competitive in smu. Hope this helps and atb in ur decision! :)"
Koufas,5,">Quite a few people kept telling me

Who are these people?

>that business is a very general degree

Have you looked at the [SOB](https://inet.smu.edu.sg/sites/courses/Student%20Handbook/BBM/BBM%20Student%20Handbook_(Intake%20AY19-20).pdf) handbook? You could consider taking a look at the courses you'll be doing and decide for yourself if you think its too general for youI think that the only reason why people call it general is because you will be learning things for different sectors of the corporate world. In Y3/Y4 when you have to start taking electives, you have to start choosing what classes you prefer. And more likely than not youll specialise right by choosing the classes that you enjoy

>and students with other degrees going to the business sector would be feasible but then it would not be the same the other way round

It depends on the role. I mean the ""business sector"" is just the private sector. Honestly, except for specialised roles with a license like Law, or if you want to pursue further studies in Psych, I really dont think that what your degree is matters as much as it used to

Nowadays internships, experiences and skills matter a lot more than GPA or field of study. Some firms like UBS explicitly state that it doesnt matter what you took when you were in school

With Free Electives and Second Majors as well, you can probably learn enough about a skillset even if that is not your first degree

&#x200B;

>i want to be able to pursue a course which has good job prospects and high pay like maybe banking sector

You can do this with any degree, although SOB, SOA, and SOE would likely get you closer to Finance depending on what kind of role you are interested in within Finance itself. A degree does not guarantee you good job prospects with high pay - for that you need to continuously learn new skills and practice during your time in uni

>i was thinking of taking up business degree and specialise in finance banking. but then now i am thinking if i should go for an accountancy degree and a 2nd major in finance banking instead?

what i am concerned about is that since i’m from jc and have no experience in anything business related, i’m afraid that i would not like accountancy since if i go for biz i can choose my specialisation aft y1.

Banking is a huge sector - so different roles would probably be more aligned with different skillsets. But there are plenty of different people in the sector. There are even social science students going for banking internships. There is someone who recently graduated with Pol Sci who secured a role in a bulge

>i’m also concerned about how those with an accountancy degree usually enter big4 and the working hours r most definitely not the best.

You don't have to enter Big 4 just because you study Accounting! Internships, skills, and experiences matter a lot more. Plenty of Accounting students also go into banking

>i’ve heard of accountants working past midnight and all.

If you want to go into Finance the working hours are not exactly known for balance

>can someone or any seniors in accountancy/biz, best if from smu advice on what i should do? or maybe share why you decided to go for accountancy or biz

You can drop me a PM with your Tele and I can connect you with someone in Accounting if you want"
chonkystranger,2,"Hi OP - I’m from biz class of 2020. Imo unless you have a clear specialised role you want, biz degree being general is a good thing. It pretty much prepares you to work in corporate setting for most sector. Give yourself the first year or so to get a taste of all the different basic courses of business, then maybe easier to understand which suits you better like more marketing comms type, strategic consulting type, finance, analytical etc.

After that you work hard on your speciality to make yourself stand out e.g find specific type of internships, courses. But at least you know what you like/are good at or what skills it requires. 

In the end it’s just a degree, it wont limit you but it won’t carry you either. Happy to share more, hope this helps :)"
One-Tail-5082,1,"hello, y3 acc student in smu here! yeah accountants generally have many horror stories practically working 24 hours a day, but there are still humane options out there (I HOPE), or as many would say that this is just the grind to accelerate later on in life. I would say that if you are not exactly into accounting, it would be tough to survive 4 years of content and studying about it. Especially if you are pretty set on exploring the finance industry next time. But I do see like close to 40-50% of my peers landing an internship/develop interest in consultancy and advisory (which are more finance roles), so the things you learn here is still relevant.

But I personally feel that in terms of modules, many business mods are more of memorising theories and doing presentations, while accounting mods are more of something that you need to spend time practising on in order to score well. Maybe you can take into consideration your learning style as well.

I am not sure what to share since this is my first time replying HAHA so can ask more if you want to."
uwubirdkawkaw,1,"Hey! SMU Biz grad here. (Class of 2021 so not that far off, but old enough that I can hopefully give some gd advice)

Biz is a very general degree, which also means that doors are open to a lot of industries. No need to worry that your JC background means you don't know anything biz related. I'd say about half of your Yr 1 mods will be fluffy (Mods like Leadership and Team Building, Marketing 101 for eg). As for other intro mods such as Biz Law, you'll get it soon enough. The heavier mods really only come in around year 2 (Sem 2)

There is really no guarantee of going into a sector that has good prospects and high pay. What is good now may not be good 4 years down the road when you graduate. Instead, what I'd feel is more important is for you to explore around in your time in SMU. Try out internships with various firms, and see if it's suited for your strengths. Can you see yourself working the same job every day for a good few years? 1 thing for sure is that, any job that offers you a high pay and low hours when you're a fresh grad is sure to be a scam. Yes, aim high, but don't be naive (Like that one NUS kid in a recent vid thinking she will command 10K as a fresh grad)

I've had friends from accountancy eventually not liking the Big4 life and leaving to preserve their sanity. They're now in totally non-accounting related jobs. I've also had non accountancy friends take the CFA exams as part of their job requirements. Honestly, half of what you learn in Uni is gonna be tossed out within half a year at work. 

So really, don't be fixated on your degree. The degree is a door opener, but isn't what dictates your future path."

Here are some tips
1) Choose ur group mates wisely
2) Revise for finals at least 1 MONTH in advance
3) Practice practice practice - the amount of practice papers i spammed for finals
4) Consult ur teachers 
5) Plan ur time properly, keep track of assignments and test dates 
6) Stay motivated, remember what ur endgoal is 

All the best, hope this helps you on ur journey. Dont listen to other people telling you whats possible or not. You are the master of your own destiny"

Ok_Ad_2696,5,I finished my np aero with 3.33. Still got into ntu and got fch anyways so just keep pushing on dun worry lol
jthepandack,3,"My first sem gpa was 3.4 and I had another sem was 3.3. I was quite upset about it but I slowly figured out a way to go around it. I graduated with a 3.7x gpa and got an offer for both NUS and SMU Business. 

You have to revise in advance and do all your tutorials. It is totally possible in Poly to revise in advance and do well by spamming exam papers because they are usually very similar. By doing your tutorials you can ask the lecturers for help before it’s too late. This will definitely help in your revision. 

If you still consider changing courses maybe you should figure out what are you interested in? I started scoring 4.0 after choosing my specialisation because I was really interested and passionate in it. Studying became something I like instead of a chore. If you’re in engineering I know some courses in NTU and NUS cutoff are 3.5x. Considering ABA, if you have a decent portfolio I’m sure with 3.5 -3.6 you will be able to get into a course in NTU and NUS. But if you would like to change courses in Uni, maybe it will be tough and you should consider either changing courses now or going to SIT/SUSS. SIT is actually a really good option considering how they are meant for mainly poly students to further their studies."
elepantstee,5,Yo guys i got a 2.28 gpa for y1s1 how screwed am i if i want to go to a local u?
Ok_Pattern_6534,8,"The solution is simple.  Just drop out of the course if one is not gonna to make it to the minimum GPA and go back to JC (that’s if his grades can make it in in the 1st place).   Another way is to start afresh in another course which he is interested in and hopefully, with interest, the GPA will show as such."
22shadesofblue,2,"First step is being aware. Next, you gotta translate that awareness to working a bit harder. I didn't have time to study in poly because most of my time were well-spent on CCAs and commute (SP and I stayed at Pasir Ris). But, what I did was learn how to take down notes effectively and maximising the time I had in classrooms. 

Important things to do:
1. Read your notes before coming to class and take note of what are some of the things you don't know and make sure the lecture/ class addresses them
2. Do your tutorial, no matter how difficult they are... attempt them.
3. Maximise your time. Time on commute is a good time to review notes - use that time to read your notes before class.
4. Ask questions about you don't understand. Make sure you ask them in class so everyone else can benefit from them too. 
5. Reward yourself but don't overindulge."

Happy-Blackberry4083,8, not too sure about this but i know of someone who failed to get into med on their first try so she just took nursing in her first year and tried again for med the next year (and was accepted then).
ExcitingYoghurt1553,2,"the thing about nus med is that they really do take in candidates with outstanding portfolios so im assuming u will be attempting to fulfil a certain number of volunteering hours, hunt for observership/shadowing experiences and probably get part-time jobs in healthcare/clinical settings. assuming that you even do manage to get all of this on your portfolio, theres still not a very good chance that you’ll get into any of the mbbs courses in sg. i think pursuing a med-related major this year is smart (nursing/biomed) so that even if god forbid you dont get accepted into med next year, at least you’re already doing something in uni and wont be wasting time, and you could also be potentially going towards postgrad med in duke or maybe overseas later on. anyways while doing this major this year, try to get all those things done (shadowing and volunteering). i understand that u may be busy with the major but im sure you could find some time to do these things since they dont really require u to be doing this all year long."

Zaptr0s,11,"From NA stream (graduated 2020), I'll answer what I can briefly. You can look at the MOE page for the NA and NT stream

1. NA goes by numerical grades, so 1 is best and 5 is just pass iirc

2. NA uses EMB3 (English, math, best other 3). 

3. It's both called N levels, but NA is more academic while I heard NT has more hands on and technical. Not too sure. Options after secondary school are also different 

4. For NA, the best options are sec 5 if they want to go JC or PFP if they want to go poly. PFP is very difficult to get in, needing 12 or better and only taking in top 10% of the NA cohort 

Cant answer 5 or 6"
Sea_Journalist3694,7,"3. 

After N(T) Levels one can go to ITE Nitec (2 years), 3 years Higher Nitec,  or sec 4NA,

NA can go to PFP (Regular poly but with an additional year), Secondary 5 to take the O Levels or DPP (2 years Higher Nitec), 3 years Higher Nitec or Nitec (2 years)

NT/NA students can be promoted to a higher stream should they meet the requirements in their sch, though that’s usually for sec 1 or 2 students only so you won’t really see sec 3 NT students for instance getting promoted to sec 4NA for the next academic year. Albeit that may differ from school to school.

SBB allows people from NA/NT to take subjects at a higher level, i.e NT student taking NA/Express math, or NA student taking express MT. I heard there will be a new system implemented in schools in the future years that will better allow students to take subjects across different levels, tho I’m not very sure about how that works.

6) Not as much of them are the studious kind like the express students so you may have to encourage them more frequently to work hard in their studies! 

4) From my personal observation, N(A) students tend to aim for PFP so they have to score <12 for their ELMAB3, but from what I have seen there tends to be at most a couple students doing well enough to get into PFP in an entire class, though of course it also depends on the school. Some may aim to go Secondary 5 instead to take the ‘O’ Levels to go to a JC or poly if they didn’t do well enough for their N Level to get into the poly (course) of their choice.

Some may also aim to do well enough to get promoted to a higher stream in the next academic year.

> What constitutes a good N Level score

Not sure for NT but for NA as most people aim for pfp, a so-so decent score would be at least 12 raw,  <10 is considered good in my opinion. But since sec 5 has no difference in duration as compared to PFP(pfp is 4 years and sec 5 ~> poly is 4 years as well), one should score at least a 19 raw, to qualify for sec 5."
Adorable-Till9947,7,"I did my N(A) levels last year and I am currently enrolled in Polytechnic.

1. N(A) and N(T) uses a numerical system where 1 is considered an A1 while 5 is considered a C6.
2. For N(A) and N(T), we use ELAMB3 which is our english, maths and best 3. We can use our CCA points to deduct from our Raw ELAMB3 though , because we cannot take HMTL, we can only deduct at most 2.
3. The difference between N(A) and N(T)  is one that one is harder and more academically rigorous then the other. As for N levels, N(A) students will take the N(A) levels while N(T) will take the N(T) levels.
4. For most N(A) students, it would be to enter the polytechnic foundation program or NAFA foundation program course of their choice. Additionally, there are a handful of students who wish to go to JC or MI to do their A levels.
5. Yes though it is highly unrecommended.
6. Well idk about N(T) but for N(A) I guess it would be to keep them motivated to pursue their goals. Throughout sec 4, many of my friends lost hope and motivation to get into pfp. This was because they either burned out or because entering pfp is very competitive."

Happy-Blackberry4083,2,Hi!! NUS has yet to get back to me too and their application portal says application processing so uh. I suppose that we didn’t get it AHAHAAH
Careful_Flamingo6001,9,"for EL:

1) Do not be afraid of booking consultations with your EL teacher, especially for oral practice! Reading Aloud and Spoken Interaction are just like your daily conversations, all you need to do is articulate your words/ideas clearly. If your teacher isn't the ""helpful"" type, practice with your friends instead.



2) For Paper 1, do a bunch of editing exercises and revise the SW formats. Ensure sophistication in your language regardless whether it is formal/informal.
VARY YOUR SENTENCE LENGTHS. It's mentally draining and tiring to read sentences of the same length over and over again. Moreover, it creates a psychological impact on the marker. (Search ""This sentence has five words"" online). More importantly, a general rule of thumb is to prioritise the PRECISION and ACCURACY of your language instead of using the most ""impressive"" words possible. In one of my essay practices, I have been marked down two bands for flowery language. This not only applies to SW, but also to every other component (Oral, CW, paper 2).

Now, I will make an emphasis on the CW component. 

*Do not confine yourself to a specific essay type!!!*
I'm aware that most people only restrict themselves to argumentative essays. There was a year where no argumentative essay came out, and many people walked out of the examination hall stunned. I'm one of the outliers who has been writing narrative essays since Sec 1, but I suddenly switched to descriptive writing around the second half of Sec 4 and it was WORTH IT. 

Essay practices are your golden opportunity to explore all the essay types and receive feedback on your areas of strength/improvement. Please don't hold back from stepping out from your comfort zone, rather do it now than be forced to do it during your O-level exams. At the end of the day, play by your strengths. It's perfectly fine to favour an essay genre but remember that the topic might not favour you! 

3) Do not overthink during Paper 2! I've struggled with this a lot, my narrative segment scores an average of 10/20 despite taking E-Lit. Do pay attention to common question types and devise your own strategies to answer them, even better if you can consolidate this with your teacher. Give them the answer they want, don't bother trying to impress them (apart from Summary Writing). 

Some question stems that appear regularly are: Give three details, Tone, In your own words, Explain fully, Irony, What makes this Effective/Unusual, etc... 

Do look through your practices and identify your common errors. Work on them. It is still possible to study for English, but unlike other subjects, you cannot be spoonfed (exception: SW formats). English is not just a game of luck, it requires skill that cannot be mugged within a day. 

Lastly, don't give up. You still have sufficient time to work on the subject. Scoring poorly for past exams/singular components doesn't mean you have to give up on the rest. You still have a chance to do well, or even better than you expected. Make sure you go into the exam hall with a clear mind, numb yourself from external problems and stay focused. During long papers, take sips of water every 30-45 minutes, but not too much. 

That's all from me. All the best!"

cai_tao_kueh,1,"I'll give you tips on cl olvls!

hello! i took chinese o lvls last year, eventually got a B3 in my exams. although i think i could have improved, but there were two incidents which shocked me during the paper. I'll just give my tips first, then I'll let you know what incidents I faced and how to avoid being in my situation!

1st tip: start listening to local chinese radio or Cdrama (which you state that you are currently doing) don't start with the famous shows, as you probably won't understand some of the words the actors are speaking. you can start with kid/teenage shows! they really helped me boost my foundation and improve my vocab bank!

2nd tip: do more practices than what is required from your teacher. to improve your chinese, you need to read and practice. ensure that you do more prelim/past year papers rather than merely the tys. yes, the tys is good but your writing standard should be much higher than that of the O Lvls. this is to help you improve greatly and prevent yourself from facing the incidents that I did

3rd tip: don't be anxious, remember to start strong and end well. if possible, during o lvl season, delete any source of media that could divulge the answers for the papers, such as Reddit and Discord. you must not be discouraged and study hard for the remainder of the exams!

anyways, here are the two incidents that I have faced:

1. 2022 O Level Chinese P3

""oh yeah, it's probably gonna be another easy LC paper. it's not important lah"" that was exactly what I thought a month, a week, a day and even an hour before the exams. WRONG.

last year's LC paper was one of the hardest LC papers i have faced. it might be easy for some, but I literally couldn't concentrate and write the correct answers for all 10 qns. eventually scored 2/10 for the LC (based on the answers from my cher)

please try and do more lc practices, it might be easy for a start, but anything could happen on that fateful day. try to answer the questions with 100% honesty, if you don't understand the listener then you can play the recording more times :) then you can ask your teacher to mark and allow her to point out your mistakes

2. 2022 O Level Chinese P1, Q5

""aiya the format is prob gonna be the same lah, no need to worry"" see? another fatal mistake by me the day before the paper. 

on that day, the question that I'm usually good at, had a different format. It was a merged expository/narrative, not a PURE expository essay. i literally panicked and just wrote some bs during the paper. i probably got 20/40 for that paper because i did not prepare for the worst. so that's something you should work on!

anyways, 现在已经半夜了，我需要停笔 🤣🤣🤣 i wish you all the best for your exams OP. let's slay the exams together!! ❤️❤️❤️"
Prestigious-Metal947,0,Study
Idkifisthrowaway,1,"El idk, but for cl it’s easy; I got A2 for both HCL and CL…

But yes overall it’s not that hard and rather easy unless you are failing in Chinese, for which I don’t think you are. 

Just watch and read Chinese articles and shows. By that I’m referring to China’s one. Especiallu for P1, don’t bother with reading Compos that your seniors or friends wrote at this stage. It’s pointless. You’re just getting stuck in that shithole of writing. Unless you have China classmates. 

Just reading or watching these Chinese shows books or articles, or even listening to Chinese music gives you an environment to improve your Chinese. Especially if you don’t speak Chinese at home. I assume you do though, so just take it as if you are introducing a China Chinese environment. 

During this period of time, remember to still do practice.  Only after a certain amount of time, you go back and see the format of the recommended passages or practices, you’ll realise how easy you find the passages."
tingggg_,1,"2022 A1 for Chinese and would recommend you to really get resources from your teacher because I’m lazy and that’s what I did. Alternatively, you can get resources from your seniors and do your own research. 加油 for Os 👍🏻"
1_vap,1,"For chinese just read more books tbh, and choose books that would help you in your essays (e.g if you like to write 情境 then read more 小说, or if you have more passion in 议论 then just read more on current affairs and collect examples which you can use as supporting evidences in a small booklet ) And i would also recommend investing in 一些辩论综艺，比如奇葩说 ( reallys helps to widen your vocab bank, content knowledge as well as learning how to phrase your sentences when you speak)

I ended up getting A1 for both Hcl and Cl although i only gotten a C5 for Hcl prelims. Tbh i feel that the A1 range is around 70-72 so dont worry that much, you dont have to do superb to get your As."

i honestly rly didn’t put in my 100% at all and i have never gotten higher than a b3 for higher chinese in sec 3, and i usually fail my WAs😀
i can only offer a few tips,
1. read a lot of model essays, as many things can be adapted to different essay topics, you just need to learn to be flexible 
2. for koushi, read alot of zaobao douhao or at least some, just to get a good idea of some potential koushi topics. i honestly didn’t rly prepare that much for koushi, i j got lucky lol 
3. as for tys, i focused mainly on doing the 短文填空，as my chi vocab sucked 
as you look thru tys, you can definitely stop trends in how qns are set, this applies to both p1 and p2 

tbh for chinese there definitely is a bell curve and it’s quite easy to get an a1 for express chinese. you rly need to know the answering techniques and tbh that’s rly it."

As for SIM, I’ve HEARD that minimum they accept is GPA 2.0? don’t take my word for this, you have to send in an enquiry with the school and check if it’s possible. I know it’s odd to hear this (for a private uni) but certain uni partners at may reject you i.e UOW & UB because they have a stricter admission criteria, but for UOL & RMIT likely have a good chance!

cooldoood56,2,"Honestly (not flexing) but I found the paper pretty simple at least p3 , p2 was manageable.  Imo alot of the questions asked were repetitive and appear alot across any chem paper, I had done my fair share of chem papers plus with a good understanding of mechanisms and chem fundamentals I could think of answers immediately which allowed to finish the paper with some time (15min-20min) to check thro. I defo thought some qns were hard or just annoying but a calm and focused mind rlly helped me tackle them. 
Maths, my jc just set incredibly impossible papers and passing them alr itself was hard so relative to my prelims A levels was much easier for me (may depend on jc ofc) since my jc had prepared me for the worst. Thus for me Maths went pretty simply as well.
I suggest you don't get worried or frightened by reactions of others as it will set you emotionally on a backfoot and will disrupt your calm and thus your logical flow. I suggest just keep grinding all your core subjects with understanding and after thar stay calm in your papers.  Surely it will be all smooth sailing after this.

nope_367,0,"Didn't take H2 Chem, but the H2 math paper was definitely tougher than expected. Not undoable, just significantly harder than the TYS. Definitely has something to do with the fact that like 70% was Calculus (Tbh mostly intergration, if they had an even spread of diff and int I'd have complained less....)

Left 13-17 marks worth blank including halfway attempts, which was surprising considering A levels are supposed to be somewhat easy compared to school papers so I had expected to be at least able to fill in the whole paper. I got an A in the end (still didn't manage to save my RP lol), overall I'd say the paper was unexpected and annoying, but definitely less challenging than school papers, thus not in any way 'most diffifult paper of my life'.

thtran_224,0,"OP, your tone...maybe some of them legit leh dont liddat

but anyway i did find the papers harder than past years. I would say comparable to 2018 paper?

P1 i remember almost crying halfway because for past TYS, i could do smoothly without skipping lol then suddenly my actual A level i skip skip skip then when i was at the last question, 18 marks blank, felt like prelims. Then I went back, in the end only 4 marks blank. Went online answers and found out i got almost everything correct for those questions I did, only marks lost were those I didn't attempt/didn't get final answers

P2 was much much better for me,, could finish whole paper with only 2 marks blank,, went online, i got final answers correct for all questions except the 2 marks blank

so definitely i did well objectively, got an A. But I definitely agree that it was trickiee than past years, especially P1. P2 was just simply a compilation of tricky questions from the past 10 years so if got do TYS...P2 can get full marks one...

H2 chem i wouldn't say it was difficult but im not sure if it was just me or the paper 3 felt quite rushing and long? P2 was managaeable, i sat there shake legs a bit LOL.

I understand what you're going through to an extent, though in my Sec 2 year not as bad as you seem to be, but I think you need a break.

Regarding your teacher, just ignore his sexism and if he's not being a help to you academic-wise, mug at home yourself. For CCA, take it lightly, don't push yourself or over-exert yourself, if you overdo it, you may get burned out or worse, injured. Perhaps talk to a trusted person about your fears and worries, getting it off your chest might help you feel better. Don't bottle it up, you may actually go crazy if u keep it in too long (trust me, I know this from first-hand experience haha)

""Mom, dad, do you want me to be a useless adult? Who can't make my own decisions? You need to let me practice making some of my own decisions and living with the consequences. If it's a bad decision, then so be it, I need to learn that for myself.""

You get to choose for yourself. You shouldn't have to care about what your father says. I feel bad and angry for you that you have to deal with this, I have never seen a case where a person's parents don't allow their child a choice even for something like a CCA.

Like it's a fucking CCA, weren't they supposed to help students to discover their interests and talents?

Overall I think your parents have your best interests in mind but choose what you have a passion for as it would make the experience much better

OhShitBye,2,"Time to start bringing up health benefits and better hand-eye coordination from sports and other stuff like that. Also it's becoming a huge thing in the workforce now to have a better well-roundedness such as some kind of sport etc. It's been proven on multiple occasions that playing some form of sport as opposed to just doing minor exercise not only has increased health benefits, but also plenty of mental benefits such as better decision-making skills, functioning better under adversity and pressure, and also makes you look better when applying for jobs. You can have really good grades, but if you have no physical health employers will also consider how many times you're going to be off sick, or if you will have health problems etc.

And honestly, we're not joking when we say we'll fund shit for you. Seriously, we'll split it.

Separately, if your parents keep making decisions for you and never talk it with you, I frankly don't see how you're going to ever be able to make choices for yourself in the future. Come 21 you're going to be suddenly taking over tons of things because you're considered a legal adult, and that includes things like taking over agency of your own life and health insurances.

v1ncent_vg,3,"context: i took amath + triple sci + ss/hist (eight subjects total)

1. i had a lot of responsibilities (council exco + cca comp team) which i prioritised over my studies until i stepped down. personally i was motivated by anxiety (didn't want to underperform + i was very certain about what i wanted to pursue post-o's and i didn't want to 'lose' the opportunity + i was expected to do well)
2. the only studying i did when there was no exams was writing notes for my content subjects. otherwise i just did my homework very consistently and clarified my doubts immediately. i also went to tuition for english/math/ss/hist, which meant i was consistently practising these subjects (but tuition isn't necessary in my opinion!) for o's i did one paper a week for emath/amath/chem/phys for about a month and whatever practices my teachers had asked us to do and were planning to go through. 
3. (to summarise: clarify your doubts with your teachers/friends + practice) english: i did editing during morning assembly from mid-t3 until o's started, i planned a lot of essays (can try timing yourself), read the news (replace whatever you do on the way to/from school with this if possible) i'm also interested in media (film/tv/lit/etc) so i watch a lot of analysis videos // maths + sci: mostly practice but you have to be very familiar with all the concepts before practising (only recommend time practices after you're familiar with everything) // ss/hist: again practice and get feedback for it, remember that you only need to remember enough content to write essays, if you have friends who are good at humans/argumentation ask them how they'd argue different factors
4. i think i've mentioned most of it already so i'll just talk about memorisation. my memory's pretty good compared to my peers so take everything with a grain of salt. honestly i'm the kind who will memorise content when exposed to it frequently (for example, for hist korean war + cold war i memorised most of it by sept just because of all the sbcs i did, things like ""on 25 june 1950, 90000 nk troops crossed crossed the 38th parallel"" or ""the bay of pigs invasion happened in april 1961"") but when trying to memorise all the content i would just reread the content enough times until i could recite it in my head and constantly recite it until the exam (used to write it out, in my opinion it's better when trying to memorise things but i couldn't nearer to my o's) again my memory's pretty good so the longest i spent on one subject was five days, the shortest was the morning of for phys since ss was the same day. (didn't prioritise bio + fell sick for p2)
5. yes it's possible! i got a1 for everything except mt (f9, but i didn't take my native language + and i didn't study at all) don't think my bio a1 was deserved cause i didn't study for it and i missed p2 but i guess cause my mcq + prac is strong it helped me a lot. TAKE CARE OF YOUR HEALTH it'll make it easier to focus on your exams, and health is something that will follow you for life vs results which only determine the immediate future

all the best!"
Iloveyousir2512,2,"1. i listen to music while studyin and usually study with my grades on the wall sooo i can always look at it and tell myself i gotta make one of them a perfect score. ( and to impress crush dont judge AHAHAHAH but helps)
2. focus in class, definitely can score, and jst study towards the night after taking a nap
3. we take the exact same subject combi except for the elctive hist, So for the others its jst spamming past year papersss. 
4. jst go with the flow, theres no teqnique, jst study, verbalise stuff, and teach others
5. yessss, but 6 subjects cus my english pulled me down to raw 9 at olevel and prelims"
JLYXsg,2,"For me hor, I just keep grinding tys every day every night. I just spend the time after sch studying, then when i go home eat dinner then i just continue to do. Just keep grinding until u get those As. I took 9 subjects got 5 A1s and 2 A2s (dont ask about the other 2 cos I flung the hcl and ss ppr). Just listen to music and get the work in. Listening to music will make the experience way better so take things slow and have fun studying"
jessychee,1,"1. I find that being interested in the subjects was key for me to be interested in studying. Subjs like phy and math really gave me a sense of gratification when i did them so it made me look forward to studying them, and I really liked the feeling of getting carried away and losing track of time when I studied, + my phy teacher was the very best imo and the way he could explain concepts so logically made me love physics. However, stuff like this cannot really be forced and lets be real, we all have subjects we hate 💀. To this, i would just say suck it up lol, thats wat I did. Motivation can only get u so far but consistency is how u get that 6 points. I rly rly hated SS but still sucked it up and did my notes consistently throughout the year. (For the record, I also had bad teachers ,for like ss and bio,which also made me lose interest in the subjects)

2. Just do whatever you can. Even if its 1-2 hours a day, its fine. I studied very little at the start of last year as well and prioritised competitions over studying. Heck, I don’t think studying alot at the start is good either bc it wld lead to burn out. What I do recommend is that you at least get enough sleep and be attentive in class and do all your homework so you dont fall behind and you still can understand most content for all of your subjects. However, aft CCA step down, you should put more emphasis on your acads

3. For humans, I used flashcards! More specifically made online ones myself using quizlet. Now in JC, Im starting to use remnote and tbh i cant tell which ones better yet so i suggest giving this method a try? When Im making flash cards it helps me rmb the content better and I occasionally go back and test myself on the concepts again (this is called spaced repetition, u can search up more info on this study technique)


Okay, I had bad teachers for bio and ss which were the heavy content subjs. Um, I feel like this is bad advice so take it with a pinch of salt but I studied the content myself when the teachers were talking on my pld and they didnt care that i wasnt listening/ tot i was using my pld for making/using flashcards 💀 bc I felt that was more productive than listening to them…

For sciences and maths, practice practice practice. Need I say more? When it came to around/after prelims period, I was doing one paper a day, timed. BUT I do not recommend doing this so early bc again, burn out. BUT MAKE SURE U DO UR TYS CLOSER TO OLVL PERIOD!!!

4. I honestly dk bc i didnt rly go finding “my own” study technique, spaced repetition is all the rage right now in study communities and its scientifically proved(i think?) to be effective so I just adapted it. Sorry, cant advise on this

5. Yuppp, took triple sci, a math emath, ss+hist, pure geog and hcl and I got 10 distinctions, 8 A1s and 2A2s(Chem & HCL) . It is totally possible and i cant emphasise how much consistency is keyyyyyy!! I pretty much didnt touch bio after prelims and still got an A1 by being consistent throughout the year(gave up bio for geog bc the paper 2 for both subjs was on the same day)"
applebottomjeansbott,1,"context i got all 8 distinctions but i can only help w math and science LOLOL bc eng and humans nt my strong suite,, i took trip sci double math 

1. honestly sec3 i was super morivated by sec4 i experienced burn out majority of the year lol but what kept me motivated in sec3 was i truly enjoyed studying the subjects and content was super interesting 💯 and my tutors and teachers r also the best they motivated me alot alot 
2. ok my schedule is abit extreme but basically i wnd cca around 630 and bc i frm sports cca damn exhausting so reach home 730 alr wna toh. so i js toh, the next day wake up 3am finish hw and study. yes i do tht most of the time but if cannot wake up then its really ok js rush hw in sch 
3. basically what i did for sciences was i booked my teachers for consult regularly and it may get tiring at some point but trust me its v worth it. like i wld do wxtra practices and ask my teachers to mark them and give me feedback, go consult and see whats wrong. and yes i am v lucky to have teachers that r super willing to help me mark and all tht but for math and science js spam like literally spam exam papers frm other sch. dk how to do a qn? ask ur teacher. note important qns that r most likely to come out, tag them thn right before exam flip thru and look at the important qns/ qns u got wrong again super super important. for geog, ss idk mindmap bro 
4. idk js spam exam papers that works for me oh and do the exam papers without referring to notes thts wht i did. active recalling

It’s a work study degree so they have one year of compulsory apprenticeship"
math_dydx,2,"To access CS-related careers, one can do so via different degree pathways. Of course, CS is the most direct pathway. But if one can't enter it, then look for degrees that are close to it and see if you are interested in studying them. Then, do CS internships during uni, go for CS competitions during uni, and do say minor in computing/CS to steer your direction towards CS-related careers. 

>\-also are there any courses that are similar to computer science?

Apart from those obvious degrees like IS that are housed under the CS department, there are other degrees that provide close alternatives. Since you are not interested in physics/engineering stuff, then you can rule out say electrical engineering which also has some machine learning stuff, and they do some hardware electrical stuff as well. To prepare for CS-related careers, a math degree is a good option (Your RP should be able to enter both NUS CHS and NTU Math). That's provided you have an interest in math and are good in math, which I am assuming so because you are considering CS since one should know CS concepts are basically mathematical logic based. You can read my post (link below) on how similar a CS degree and a math degree are. Basically, you can build the math degree to consist of more than half of what a CS degree learns.

[https://www.reddit.com/r/SGExams/comments/114hy6r/how\_similar\_is\_a\_computer\_science\_degree\_to\_a/](https://www.reddit.com/r/SGExams/comments/114hy6r/how_similar_is_a_computer_science_degree_to_a/) 

Your RP is exactly the 10th percentile of NTU College of Science Double Major Programmes, which include NTU Double Major in Math and CS. (Single degree NTU CS 10th percentile is 82.5 RP. Not sure if anyone knows could this specific double major has a lower cut-off than the single major CS degree lol.) So u can try for this double major, which in fact gives u stronger training in math, than the single major in CS.

You can also try for NTU Math with a second major in data analytics (Your RP should have no problem getting this), which allows you to take more modules from the CS department to complement your math degree.

yeah vectors is one of the hardest topics for most people, the rest of the pure math topics usually have pretty standard procedure to follow when solving questions.

As for statistics, can’t give you a definite answer as I haven’t learnt most of it yet but the topics I’ve covered so far (Probability and P&C) are manageable if you understand the context of the qns and these 2 topics will be commonly applied in other stats qns.

tbh vectors took me q awhile to understand. I had to go n study it by reading through lecture notes to understand the concepts then tried to do similar vector qns until I grasped the concept. I even wrote notes to help me internalise HAHA & also bc vectors actually only has a few key concepts. it gets better w time!

also I found all the other h2 math topics easier than vectors LOL. a lot of ppl also struggle w vectors. I ended up getting an A for A levels HAHA so don’t worry too much js try ur best/ask ur teacher for consult :-)

my math teacher alw helped us by summarising the key concepts for each topic which rlly helped a lot"
mai1_,8,my sch also started on vectors first and i srsly don’t understand anything ☠️
EfficiencyEfficient2,6,"Yo former ny h2 math highest for prelim and fmath student here (hehe flexing a bit sry)

Hardest topic can rlly depend from person to person because each topic has its own type of challenges

Vectors is typically hard because its an abstract way of basically doing geometry. For me it really got easier once after familiarising myself with all the base properties (addition, scaling, modulus, dot and cross product) and then working on my geometrical intuition. You also need to recognise whether its a vector algebra qn, a lines qn or a planes qn . Once you get those down, start trying to turn every vectors problem into a gc problem bcos when youre able to recognise what kind of problem it is it typically just bcms a case of solving simultaneous equations. For eg you can use gc to: find line and plane end, find coordinates in a plane or line, and do ratio theorem qns which hv multiple unknown ratios and multiple eqns.

Basically try and turn everything into a gc problem hehe. Familiarising yourself w your gc may be a tedious process but it saves you a lot of time in exams if you recognise you can just plug in numbers to your gc instead of working it out yourself. And that goes for every h2 math topic, not just vectors lol.

So yea h2 math does get better, but you need to put in the work. One good advice my tutor gave me when we started fm lessons was to get good at math, practice understanding things abstractly (like x^y) and concretely (2^3) because both kinds of qns are tested. And ofc keep grinding bcos math is a test of mental endurance (3h papers :0, getting tired or panicking in the middle of exams is honestly a big problem). But just note that grinding more may not alw be productive. Each time you do math, always think, ""Is there a more elegant solution? Can i make this shorter and faster?"" Do this and youll probably do better. In my case bcos i always think like that im often able to find unconventional shortcut methods to do qns faster. Its an experience thing lol (which is why practice is impt).

So yea h2 math can either get better or worse depending on the topic and your strengths and weaknesses

Here are sm topics and their challenges:

1)Differentiation techniques + applications
Often a test of your algebra since you have to do chain rule, quotient rule, implicit differentiation, solving min/max eqns, etc. Advice here is to just take it slow at first and make sure your algebra is correct. Once you have consistently correct algebra, speed is just a matter of practicing more. Rmbr, theres no point doing things fast if youre wrong.

2) integration techniques + applications
Often times what ive seen students struggling w is recognising which identities to use and which techniques to use. Tbh just practice (eye power comes from practice lol). Being good at differentiation helps too bcos sometimes you can recognise what identity to use bcos uk how to differentiate the final answer.
As for applications, get good at visualising areas and volumes mentally and give yourself step by step goals to meet while working toward the final ans. Like maybe youre finding the area of a ring made by rotating two lines. Youd first have to rotate the outer line and find that volume, then rotate the inner line to get that volume, then you have to subtract away the smaller volume from the larger one.

Lol ive rambled on and on abt math, but thats just cos i rlly enjoy h2 math. Once you get good its pretty fun to see what kinds of qns they can give you. Ive seen wacky qns like a wizard making a castle in ball and finding its volume and doing economics with math (finding price, qty, surpluses, etc)

Anyway i think im talking too much and nbody likes a know it all right. So just hit me up w a dm for anyth h2 math related if you want. Can give you gc tips, tell you whats hard abt diff topics more in depth and help guide you through qns lol. Though may not alw reply fast cos im in ns rn 🙃.

Ps: if yore from hci or nj dont feel bad if youre doing badly in h2 math. Your papers are just harder. Id say if you can get a C in your school papers its very possible to get an A in alvls. I love nj and hci papers bcos theyre the best h2 math practice besides my own schools papers"
Impossible-Yam4571,6,"A lot of schs actually start on vectors as the first chapter haha. And yes back in JC I struggled with vectors a lot because it’s very demanding on the visualisation, trigonometric and algebraic skills required. For me how I got better at it was to actually re-read my lecture notes and re-do all my tutorial qns after the chapter is over. I’ll also seek consults with my math tutor. I only truly got the hang of vectors in June as I was preparing for my MYEs in J1. So I’d say with time it should get better. But it will def take a lot of effort :)"
No-Dog-4908,4,"Jp also only covered 1/3 of vectors 💀💀 but it’s quite doable for now, with the exception of a few parts in some qns"
haisufu,3,"short answer: yes it does

I share other commenters' confusion as to why your school decided to start on vectors as its first topic of H2 maths. Vectors require a different way of visualisation to understand the concept, so that the formulae make sense - especially things like vector products. So I don't blame you for finding it difficult.

I did A levels 10 years ago but I vaguely remember my school starting on functions which was basically algebra. Then went on to do graphs, inequalities, complex numbers and calculus. Vectors if I remember correctly was the final pure maths topic before we went onto probability and statistics

if you have been generally doing well for sec sch maths, you should find the other topics a bit more familiar but obviously at a higher level than before. you should still remember the basics of differentiation and integration, but the functions are now more complex, including logarithmic and trigonometric ones.

ultimately, I think it's fine to have one weak topic, if it turns out to be vectors. personally I sucked at probability (which sounds ridiculous but it's true). I could just never work out what formulae to use for simple 'choose 1 ball from 8' questions. so I made sure to be as good as I could in all other topics, so that overall my score would be decent. I might get 1/8 for the probability question, but get 9/10 on calculus, functions etc. questions. obviously this 'method' is not for everyone but it might be a practical alternative"
snowpyne,3,"Wtf if my school had started with vectors back then it probably would’ve scared me off to poly. We started with D&I.

But anyway consider watching 3blue1brown's vids on linear algebra. Might be a bit too extra for JC level (since it's a intro to uni-level linear algebra) but I think understanding the big picture is important in understanding the concepts in vectors."

HebuBall,2,"Vectors is one of the harder topics initially due to visualization, some drawing and it being so different from most other topics. But honestly it isnt too bad once you get the hang of it, which is why it is the first topic as you get to practice vectors for the rest of the 2 years."
ExcitingYoghurt1553,2,"bro i completely understand, i despised vectors bc it was just a hassle to get used to it and understand, especially the scalar and vector product qns. the latter half which will cover lines and planes is honestly hard to understand, but its a give away in exams when uve learned it properly. it just takes time to get used to vectors and apply them so yea practice practice practice and keep revisiting your school notes and tutorials on it to catch up. this phase of “vectors is alien language” will essentially pass. the next few topics will be child’s play for u after doing vectors and the content wont really get much harder until the end of j1 👍"

IntrovertUsingReddit,4,"Q1: YES WE DO but dont worry its quite hard to fail if u pay attention during lessons. Quite easy to pass 👍🏻👍🏻

Q2: Some are based on project work, some base on tests like Math for example. Language n comms mostly is project based but can also have individual projects as well. (Idk about other courses but shld be the same ah)
Like for me Sem 1 got speech assignment (if im not wrong) n other projects 
Sem 2 got an individual assignment need write emails n summary etc. and other projects as well
Haha no lah failing one test doesnt mean bye bye.. Each project/test got different percentages so like just need pass for all project/test should be fine (Forgot how they calculate percentages haha but all ik is ALL modules need to be above 50%)
So like if u fail 1 test (bit risky ah), need to rely on other assignment/projects to lift up your grades lor 

Q3: Percentage of passing is quite high, very low got fail one (Lecturer told me) 
Just gotta pay attention in class👍🏻👍🏻

Q4: PFP honestly for me at the start is DAMN stressful 😭😭 Like once one project/assignment is done, the lecturer give out another one alr (And thats across 6 modules.. Imagine💀) 
But overall even tho its stressful, theres still like classmates willing to help lah so (for me personally anyways)

Yes, you will see a lot of people mugging now, but as a J2, I feel that the majority of them will fizzle out soon. You see, the motivation is extremely high since JC just started and you are now in one of the top JCs. But motivation usually does not last long, it will then be up to discipline and consistency. Yes, they SEEM to be mugging, but are they studying right? I noticed my JC schoolmates seem to be hard at work at the tables, but they love to scroll through Instagram, Tik Tok or play some games. They do that at very frequent intervals. Let me tell you, mugging now is not the way to go. I as a J2, don't intend to mug hard too at this stage as I foresee burnouts that can outweigh how much I studied. I remember back then I was busy cramming information on my notes, WORD FOR WORD. But I was still failing, I don't understand anything. Recently, I simply just spent 1 hour, got into a flow state of mind and took the time to understand concepts. In the test, while I could not 100% give my answers, I could at least understand questions and input in some keywords that I have seen. I feel confident for that paper. Any problems immediately consult.  
Conclusion:  
Do not be pressured by the extreme mugging culture as you might suffer. Understand that JC you are not going to get straight As. Every test just improve by a bit. Learn from mistakes. You got this. We are all gonna make it."

Whacksteel,8,"I graduated from a mugger jc 6 years ago, and am now doing q well in uni. But I struggled a lot in those 2 years, and perhaps in vain. There's a difference between working hard and working smart: in your case, you'd have to do the latter because you don't have the time.

There are 2 reasons why people don't do well: concept formation failure, and recall failure. Failure to form concepts refers to the inability to grasp the gist of the learning material and combine it with what you already know. This seems to be the problem for you. What I'd advise is to take information from other sources, not just the lecture notes and tutorial worksheets. The internet is at your fingertips: youtube, blogs, you name it they have it. That's how I learnt my H2 econs and some of my uni modules. Find some material that explains the concepts in a way you understand.

The second reason is recall failure. Essentially you already know the concept, but you can't seem to activate it when the question asks for it. Either because you don't know that the question is asking for it, or that you don't know how to apply the concept. For this, the tutorial worksheets come in handy to guide you on how the questions will be phrased in your exams, and how to best approach those questions. But a word of caution: don't bother with the tutorials until you've grasped the concept fully; it's pointless to do the worksheets over and over, hoping you'll be able to understand it. You'll only be doing rote learning, which is counterproductive. 

As other commenters have mentioned, watch your pace so you don't burn out. It's a sprint to A levels, sure, but it's still 2 years. Get adequate rest and take some time to enjoy your hobbies. Atb!"
metaHC,16,"Is 4h2 worth even? 

Will dropping the 4th h2 to h1 help boost my chances of getting A for that subject? 

Will dropping a h2 give me more time to focus other stronger subjects to guarantee A?

If yes and yes, strongly consider.

Also regarding all those full time muggers, those are the people who study hard not study smart. Not surprisingly, those are the people who also get back mediocre grades for term assessments and promos. 

Don't get pressured by others who study and don't understand wtf they doing. Focus ur ownself with ur own pace. Easier said than done, but the dgaf attitude and go home study worked better for me."

potatothegeek,3,"Relax your expectations from secondary school, you can't always be the best; and even if you are now, the lesson is that you will always meet people better. If your question is ""is it just me?"", the answer is almost always no; you're going through what batches and batches of seniors before you have.

The pacing for lectures in NY is deliberate as far as I'm aware, the intention is to briefly introduce you to the content so that the thinking is left to you as you attempt tutorials. That's why you see tables of people mugging together: it's way easier to divide the thinking amongst your peers, understand them together, explain it to the slower ones if you're faster, etc. If that doesn't work, your tutors are quite willing to help provided you approach them early and show them where you're struggling."

Consider thinking about your goals, both long-term and short-term, and how they might align with the course of your choice. It would be even better if you are able to point to past experiences and share how, specifically they have developed you either a) as a person or b) to help you become closer towards a goal of yours - whatever that might be

If they see that you are genuine about what you want to do and that this is a step towards a better tomorrow (and that the student populace will benefit from having you in it than not) - that usually helps"

math_dydx,7,">but i have zero experience in coding and programming.

Actually, don't need to worry about this so much. Because during year 1, they will teach coding assuming you never learn before. But of course, the best is to pick up some coding and learn some basic algorithms (like searching and sorting) before uni. But generally, if you are good at math, there is a high chance you should be good at coding/algorithms as well since both share similar kind of skillsets in logical thinking.

>DSAI is such a new course so im unsure of the employability and job prospects.

DSAI is not that new already. GES already has its graduates' salaries.

>DSAI is 50% math and 50% CS, and DSAI does more math than CS

Yes, you can see clearly from the curriculum that DSAI trades off some CS modules in the CS degree to take more math/stats modules than the CS degree.

NTU DSAI is designed for students who already know that they most likely will go into the data science and AI field. So the curriculum will focus on taking modules that are closely relevant to the data science and AI field. However, more often than not, students don't exactly know what they want before uni. By that, I meant that those who have some interest in data science and AI might be also quite open to being a statistician, cryptanalyst, etc. at this current juncture (before uni). A lot of times is when students started taking year 1 uni modules then they start to realise where their real interest lies, as well as which area of CS/math is not their cup of tea. Unless you are very sure you want to go into the data science and AI field (so you are sure you want to get trained specifically for this area), it would have been better to go for a much more generic CS degree or math degree.

Since you are looking at DSAI (which has more math than CS), and you mentioned you have an interest and love for math, how about considering NTU Double Major in Math and CS, which with your RP you should be able to get in. The double major will give you more space to discover which area of math and CS u enjoy during uni, rather than straight away focus on DSAI. Also, you get to open more doors and access to careers that are available to both CS major and Math major. Also, you can capitalise on your interest/strength in math to become a CS graduates that has much stronger math foundation than those single major in CS graduates.

[https://www.ntu.edu.sg/spms/about-us/mathematics/undergrad/degree-programmes/macs-2021](https://www.ntu.edu.sg/spms/about-us/mathematics/undergrad/degree-programmes/macs-2021) (NTU Double Major in Math and CS Curriculum)

The double major allows for specially-tailored specialisations that lie at the intersection of both CS and math, which are: Theoretical Computer Science, Cryptography and Cybersecurity, Financial Modelling, and Data Science. As a double major in Math and CS, you would have the advantage of a strong foundation in math and CS in years 1 and 2, to pivot to these 3 other specialisations, should your interest change and deviate away from data science stuff.

The math modules in this double major are much more rigorous than the math modules taken by NTU DSAI. Some math modules taken by NTU DSAI have less depth compared to this double major and NTU Math single major. In particular, we take a look at year 1 math modules. NTU DSAI takes MH1805 Calculus, MH1812 Discrete Mathematics, and MH2802 Linear Algebra for Scientists.

MH1805 Calculus (4AU) is the less depth version of MH1100 Calculus 1 (4AU) and MH1101 Calculus 2 (4AU) combined. MH1812 Discrete Mathematics (3AU) is the less depth version of MH1300 Foundations of Math (4AU) and MH1301 Discrete Math (3AU) combined. MH2802 Linear Algebra for Scientists (3AU) is the less depth version of MH1200 Linear Algebra 1 (4AU) and MH1201 Linear Algebra 2 (4AU) combined. NTU Math single major and NTU Double Major in Math and CS both Year 1 curriculum involves all in-depth versions MH1100, MH1101, MH1200, MH1201, MH1300, MH1301. Thus, if you are interested in math but not sure if the data science and AI field are for you, then the double major will be better in giving you a stronger math foundation.

SeeAssWithMe,2,NUS CS would give you most versatility in terms of career choices in the future
rcRollerCoaster,1,">im definitely leaning towards NUS CS due to the prestige of it all (although i dont think this is super valid lol...)

Computing is one field where, from what I've heard, they don't rlly care which uni you come from when hiring

This is not to say there is no good reason to choose NUS over NTU. I've heard great things about NUS Computing profs and NUS offers more flexibility than NTU on double degrees and double majors.

On the other hand, NTU has it own advantages. For instance it's easier to get a Hall spot in NTU than in NUS, if you are interested in staying on campus.

This is just a small number of the differences between the two unis, I'll leave it up to you to read up more on both unis and consider what your priorities are

>4. is NTU's CS really that bad? (i saw posts about the bad and out of date teaching. plus employers seem to prefer NUS CS students, and i saw that NUS CS grads have a higher starting pay and employability)

I am someone with similar principles to you (alcohol tastes like shit change my mind), I dislike the idea of hook ups,I don't like smoking or clubbing etc. but I've always been able to find ppl who vibe with me, even if they were a small minority. 

In pri sch I had 3 friends and all of us enjoyed anime, kpop and jpop, in sec sch I found one girl who enjoyed the same anime as me and she introd me to her studious friends who I thought I had nth in common with at first, but overtime we alll became friends. In JC almost my whole class was party culture but I found 2 other ppl who were like me and although they had common interests whereas I did not, we still vibed tgth and we hung out to eat, do geeky stuff and study tgth. 

These relationships are also not to be underestimated bc my friendship with my sec sch friends is still going strong 7 years in. And tbh even though my class was partying type, they nvr made the 3 of us feel unwelcome and accepted us the way that we were. They did not leave us out of plans and even modified plans to suit our needs as well (they wld have alcohol, but those who didn't drink also had really fun activities and their own drinks). 

My point is that ppl like you defo exist in this gen,and they exist all arnd tbh. However they are indeed a minority so u need to find them. And even if they are not, this gen is very open minded in general and as long as you state your boundaries clearly, they will accomodate you to allow you to be included. If they don't, you can always make more friends! (No friendship cap unlike in genshin)"
Not_Cube,17,"Look I completely understand where you're coming from. I've never been into a club before, never smoked/ vaped, and only drink occasionally. I've never rly seen the appeal of getting completely plastered tbh. My ideal night is either playing games/ piano or binging clips from random shows.My Spotify breakdown is literally 90% JPOP and classical. 

Point being, do what floats your boat! If you are focused on making money now, do that. Don't feel the need to conform to society cos if it's what you don't like to do you'll just end up burnt out and depressed. If you don't want to have flings and just want to date to get married, then do that. Or hold pen before hold hand lol.

ForwardBed4817,26,"Dude, thank god you have the common sense to reject getting wasted. Stay home with your dog, walk them, who knows your pet is a chick magnet 😂

Drinking is bad, real bad. It’s very easy to become an alcoholic and your friends seem to be so. Health problems always appear invisible to the naked eye.

Concentrate on improving yourself. Never mind that you have no chicks, look into yourself and decide what you want. You seemed young from your group of friends, so treasure that youth. As you get older, you’ll have less time for yourself and your hobbies. The most important thing is first, learn to be content with yourself. Once you make peace with your loneliness, your life goals will naturally change.

I see that you’re looking to work hard and earn money. So go ahead and do that but, don’t lose your humanity in the search for wealth. There’ll never be a lack of money.

I spent a lot of my time during my army and uni years just being by my lonesome. I would tell people that I was just ""finding myself"" when in reality I was indulging in video games while disassociating with reality and my problems. It was kinda depressing tbh. That was until I realized I should really just give up that self-importance and arrogance of thinking I was ""much more mature than others my age."" 

Fast forward a couple of years since and I had recently begun going to clubbing events again with my colleagues only to find myself actually enjoying it again. (Partying to a reasonable extent at least). I had a friend who would always go ""aiyo drink until like that fun meh?"". And I felt it was so shitty because it's hardly a sign of maturity, it just seemed really pompous and dismissive to me. Actual maturity is when you understand everybody is different while being able to ""play ball with others"", subscribe to the program and compartmentalize.

Maybe you can try to observe people's lifestyles before forming deeper relationships with them. Hope you meet more people who think like you in the near future.

i live how i want to live. if i don’t want to club or drink or hookup, my party friends aren’t gonna jeer me for being too prim and proper. 

honestly people can tell when you’re secretly being judgemental and feeling morally superior to them, just because your body count is non-existent or whatever. so if you just mind your own business and let other people do as they please, you won’t feel so “out of place”. if you respect them, they will respect and like you for who you are too. what rule is there that virgins can’t be friends with non-virgins?

it truthfully appears to me that you are looking for people to form a mini echo chamber to reassure you that your friends are westernised degenerates who live immoral promiscuous lifestyles and you, you are the pinnacle of morality and goodness and pure asian values. i wonder how your friends would feel hearing you talk down about them this way 💀"

even if i date, i’m not planning to lose my virginity until marriage

learnt blackjack when i was 13(?)…or more of tried to learn blackjack — but even now at the age of 21…honestly I have forgotten the rules (e.g double $$, triple $$ etc) already and i only join in once in a while (which is once every few years🤡🤡)

have never learnt mahjong or any other gambling cause my logic is…no gamble = no risk of losing money = money remain with me

personally for me, all my friends are the same as me; 

we would rather stay home, binge watching a show than getting wasted, vomiting at CQ

we would rather chase after the latest food or series/movie that’s trending than to chase after a relationship that we might not be ready for

i only have 1 friend that actually know how to drink (family culture — but don’t really visit clubs etc), 2-3 that mahjong and the rest of us are simply considered as “nerds” i guess in this day and age

so ye it’s just happens that the people you’re surrounded with are in that culture

there are certainly more people out there that don’t drink, smoke , gamble or engage in any of the things that you have mentioned (& just simply outside of my friend circle, i know a lot more)

You should find yourself some new friends - ones that have the same priorities in life as you - like making money. It is highly admirable for young men to be interested in things besides hedonism and getting STI's.

GryffinBehemoth,6,"How diff is it studying in poly, its really more about taking charge of your own learning. 

If you’re aiming for the big 3 after poly, you def need to keep ur grades up. all ur modules usually have different weightage. for me, once the timetable comes out, i’ll see which modules are of heavier weightage then i know which ones i’ll have to put more effort into. scoring badly for a heavy weightage module drags ur gpa down way more as compared to lighter weightage modules. 

Also, pls do well for the first semester since thats your base gpa. kinda hard to recover/pull up afterwards if you do badly.

There will be things like pre-lesson materials/read ups before lesson, whether u wanna read it or not up to you. 

Lesson tutorials, you may or may not be required to submit these. in the case where submission is not required, a lot of people tend to not do. but pls for your own good, go and do. 

Doing tut will let you know which parts of the lesson you don’t uds or have troubles with. its then up to you whether or not you bring these questions/uncertainties up during or after class to clarify with ur lecturer. if you dont clarify and end up scoring badly for common tests or exams then thats on you. they won’t single you out, ask you stay after class and give you extra help. 

I’d say making friends isn’t the most important thing but they’re good to have. you can always fall back and rely on them for anything academically related, life would definitely be easier and more fun with them around. but even if you don’t make any, its fine. i’ve seen lone wolves who always stuck by themselves throughout the whole 3/4 years and they got around just fine. 

Just be yourself? from my experience even if you fake it till you make it, after awhile ppl can tell and it gets kinda awkward. oso constantly living like that very tiring sia. don’t be too worried about the friend part, i was also initially worried about this too but my siblings told me friends come to you naturally and they really did. i only really got close to my clique after internship ended.

I’m not sure what context your leadership position applies to. if its for CCA im not too sure (i didnt join any). if its leadership positions for things like group projects/school work, im pretty sure this kind of thing usually is u form ur own grps and decide by yourselves; your lecturer aint got so much time decide this kinda thing. 

Idt u nid to suck up to your lecturers, i doubt they’ll show you any form of favouritism even if u do. imo kinda turn off when ppl did this openly.

I’m not rlly sure whats this portfolio thingy you’re referring to.

If you have the luxury (time and $) and there is a particular CCA u like, pls join. i realise now i don’t really have anything wholesome to write about in my personal statement when applying for uni..


Poly ain’t that hard, just have fun and know when to be serious (studying etc..)"
Zaptr0s,2,"Poly treats you like an adult, so it's really quite independent. Secondary school teachers may always say they treat you like ""a young adult"" but it's nothing like poly

Lecturers are mainly there to teach. If you have assignments the deadline is just stated in the brief and you have to plan accordingly to submit on time. Sometimes they may say ""pls remember deadline is XXX"" but not always, and if you submit even a second late you get hit with the penalty (in SP it's an instant 50% deduction ouch). They also don't care much for your attendence, they won't bug you to come if your attendence is getting too low

Friends are very important I would say. Studying with friends is very helpful, and you want people to group up with for group assignments. The worst thing to your mental health and grade is if you end up with slackers

Most lecturers don't know what you're doing outside their classes, so unlikely that your involvement in CCAs will give favouritism. Do CCAs anyway. 

From what I know the form teacher (or equivalent, they don't call that here) pick class rep by election and CCA leaders by interview and involvement

Portfolio... Isn't about having friends. It's about what youve done to shown you have interest in the domain. For example if you want to be a software dev you will want to show the coding you have done. Leadership also can count in your portfolio but that isn't exactly about having friends

Also more on CCA, from what I know it's mostly managed by the exco. If you go for sessions, chances are you may not see a teacher there, maybe just a coach for sports CCAs. CCAs tend to be held from evening to night on school days. So your CCA experience will be vastly different from secondary school

Edit: adding that you can join 2 or even more CCAs if you feel like. Attendance is also not mandatory at all (unless you have obligations in the CCA) and you can simply not turn up and you only lose getting CCA points if you don't turn up enough (depends on poly though, in SP it's really fine to miss out on those)."

Alone_Abrocoma_9666,5,"1. what h2 econs is abt- ngl right now it may seem a bit basic but it could get more interesting as you learn how the concepts play into the real world. i’ll split them into sections rather than units bcus i don’t be sooo exact abt the content but rather the concepts learnt

micro econs: i would split this into 3 sections

section 1: the market (demand supply - ddss) 
- understand the factors affecting the change in demand and supply (ie increase or decrease)
- understand the factors affecting the elasticity of ddss (ie why the slope looks the way it is - on the graph! and how that affects the change in price & qty)
- adjustment process (ie how price & qty is determined) 
- **ngl a bit dry but it forms like the foundation 

section 2: market failure (mf)
- reasons for mf - over/under consumption/productions (externalities - negative/positive effects, info failure + real life examples eg lemon law or the coe market) 
- ** my favourite topic omg was so easy to understand and apply

section 3: market structure (ms)
- types of market(firms) + examples (perfect competion/monopoly/monopolistic competition/oligopoly - you’ll learn their characteristics and the benefits and drawbacks of each)
- strategies that firms can use to compete 
- ** a lot of analysis here but the qns are always super interesting to me in the case studies

macro econs: i would split this into 2 sections (ngl had a much better time learning macro econs bcus it makes more sense to me)

section 1: macro issues
- economic growth (causes, types, benefits, A LOT of strategies + examples)
- unemployment (causes, types, effects, solutions)
- inflation (causes, types, effects, solutions)
- balance of payments(basically like budget deficits etc and also again causes, types, effects, solutions)
- ** for this one there’s a lot of cross analysis needed eg qns like conflicting objective - should the govt prioritize something over something else or which one is the best strategies wrt to the situation the country has etc)

section 2: globalization 
- comparative advantage (ie the main concept of how countries are better at producing something and should trade those etc) + patterns/determinants of trade
- causes, benefits, disadvantages & strategies for globalization
- **shorter section and a lot of overlap w section 1 but vv interesting ngl and good for know for essays

also overall just want to say that this is not all and not 100% accurate but this was what i remembered/found impt to cover for As"
ukindasusthough,5,i think you’ll have to take into consideration that bio a levels is often on the same day as hist ☹️ the bio students in my hist class really struggled with the amt of content they had to memorise on the day itself
ExcitingYoghurt1553,2,"hello finished my As in 2021 and did BCMe

1. im not so sure about h2 econs bc i took h1 econs but from my understanding, the first unit is always central economic problem (understanding the idea of how resources are scarce and that there are outcomes u will have to sacrifice/forgave), demand and supply (how demand for goods and the supply for it work in markets and how they are impacted, including govt polices to impact these markets), market failure (literally how markets fail and what govt can do to intervene with policies) and this is what i rmb for microecons. for macro theres the standard of living section which covers the indicators for how good standard of living is in nations, theres ad/as which is about the goods in a country and not just a single market and finally govt fiscal and supply polices to impact the ad/as. this what we did for h1 econs. from what i rmb h2 econs had market structure and black market in addition but im not the best person to answer this question 😅.

2. from my understanding, history is generally found to be more difficult to score in and study for than econs based off of how i saw my friends doing for h2 hist vs h2 econs. ull find way more resources for econs than hist as well and tbh hist would be more suitable for u if ure better with memory work and extremely long essay writings but i would personally vouch for econs

3. both of them are perfectly fine because theyre your contrast subject out of the 4 so theres rly no difference 

4. cant answer this bc ive not studied hist in my life but my friends generally dreaded it in jc from what i rmb

5. honestly i think bcme sounds the best for me simply bc it’s popularised combi and almost half the people in ur jc will be taking econs but if u really have a passion or liking towards history (it does sound pretty interesting in terms of the content) then of course there’s no problem in taking up bcmh. its just that its one of the most content heavy subjects in a levels so people usually tend to shy away. as for uni courses, considering that you’re fixed on social sci/humans, your combi is perfectly fine be it bcme/bcmh so dont worry about it too much. i can advise u well on bcm bc these were my forté 😈 for bio and chem make sure ure keeping up with your jc’s pace for content bc u rly dont wanna find yourself studying topics by yourself and not understanding them sufficiently before exams bc the topics can be quite difficult to understand sometimes as a j1. for math this doesnt apply much? bc most jc lecture notes for math are quite extensive and you can still study them yourself but just make sure ure putting in enough practice for them. i always tell my j1 h2 math tutees to use the june and december hols VERY well for math to consolidate and practice it."

Ultimately, the decision is up to you. There isnt any specific way to stay motivated because everyone has different life experiences.

Money_Ad_9800,2,"Hello there. Sharing from what I know based on prev CHS related talks. Prospective CHS student here matriculating this academic year.

Btw CHS online open house is tmr! U can ask more qns there!!
https://chs.nus.edu.sg/nus-oh2023/


Let me clarify some terms:

Double Major/Second Major: You need to complete 10 modules (40MCs) for your 2nd major. No pre-requsites that need to be fulfilled if you did not apply through direct admissions. You can declare a 2nd major at the start of the semester once you have matriculated. 

Double Degree: You need to complete 15 modules (60MCs) for your 2nd CONTRASTING degree type i.e. Bachelor of Science (Hons) and Bachelor of Arts (Hons). Examples includes - Life Science and Psychology. If you are not offered a structured double degree upon admissions, you can only apply it after completing 60MC to 80MCs (ie 15 to 20 modules) and GPA of 3.5 and above.

To your qn on life science and public health, yes you can drop the minor in public health once you've matriculated. If you thereafter wish to pursue a 2nd major in public health, you need to complete a certain set of modules and apply to the portal for approval as 2nd major in public health is restricted. But public health minor is open, no requirements or approvals needed

Hope this helps. Lmk if u have questions !!"
rcRollerCoaster,1,">so my question is that upon matriculation can I declare a double major or second major of my choice? or do I need to have a certain score maintained after a semester before I can declare the following?

Yes, you can drop the minor

Hes, you can apply for a new minor (which may be open or restricted, refer to reddit post linked above for details)

No, you are not obligated to continue it"

20tiethjuly,5,"yes, history courses at NUS exist. they are under FASS iirc. i’m looking at history at uni too and iirc the igp for the 10th percentile was approx 78rp. there are no subject requirements for local uni history.

for overseas uni history courses such as UK, broadly speaking (from some of the uni websites i’ve checked out) you MAY OR MAY NOT be considered as strongly compared to someone who takes h2 history or other h2 humanities subjects (you can check on individual unis’ websites). so yes, your combi may put you at a disadvantage. some unis even do have a requirement to take A level history to be eligible for uni history. and while you do take h1 history, UK unis generally only look at your H2s and they actually mostly dc abt h1 subjects at all. but i can’t confirm this for your case. additionally, i’m not sure about US unis’ history courses.

but anyways, if you’re looking into UK, i highly recommend for you to go and check out the individual unis’ websites and check the subject + grade requirements. as well as some research on the unis you are considering. nonetheless, i hope you are able to take history at uni regardless of your combi! all the best!!"

thelegoknight100,9,"Hi there. Current JC2 here. Honestly, I find myself quite a fortunate and happy person. Sure, I feel down at times due to a vice I do at times or because I wasn’t productive. But generally, I feel relaxed. 

What I think is important is sleep. I go to bed at 10pm and wake up at 5.40am (6am on non-school days). This helps me feel less tired as I never have to deal with sleepiness most of the times (except some classes because I am that bored). Ensure you have a correct sleeping habit, such as avoiding screens one hour before hitting the sack. This helped me get through my CA days better than my peers who seemed dead for days.

Exercise is important too. I do several exercises at home such as IPPT training, weights and pull up practice. The sense of accomplishment and discipline can boost your mood.

Everyday I take a evening stroll too about 30 minutes before sleep. I take the time to reflect on my day. I will give myself motivation speeches. I will detect what was wrong and how I should correct them. Sometimes I think of my crush… Wait, I mean just take the time off to enjoy the sky, air and peace.

Regular breaks help me too. I would read a book, scroll through a forum, memorise the SAF 8 core values and more. Do something meaningful which takes your mind off work. Social media is discouraged. (I am guilty of scrolling through Reddit and YouTube though)

As seniors told me, don’t mug for A-Levels now, you will burn out. I strongly believe in this as I faced burnout before and I felt terrible. Just try and catch up on whatever is taught now. Only if you have completed what is due, then spend a bit of time revising. Consistency is better than mugging large amounts at once.

I know you said you dislike routines, but having a routine helps to bring out discipline and consistency. The mindset has to change to be more welcoming to new things. Regarding friends, while I am a friend to all and have good friends, but I only meet them face to face in school. No one really asks me out during the weekends or holidays. I usually am the one organising extremely rare outings. (How do my friends find time to party and date?) 

In the end, I still have things to work out. I am slowly trying to be more productive. I am trying to catch up. Because I am grateful and usually happy, I have the mental state to continue. I hope you find joy, we are all gonna make it."
iamlookingawxy,3,"the comment above is good, basically the very basic things:
1. sleep well. different people need different amounts to function well, maybe you’re good at 6-7h, maybe 8-9h is better for you. Figure out what works for you. sleep is so impt for memory consolidation and attention, don’t take sleep for granted.
2. eat well. Healthy foods, but also remember fun foods that you like! 
3. exercise/physical movement/exposure to sun. This will also help with sleep. Even just walking counts. 
4. fun activities. Inclusive of hobbies, just stuff you like. Even if it’s Netflix, it’s ok.
5. calming/relaxing activities. I picked up mindfulness meditation during my A level year. You can also try journalling, colouring, art, etc. 
6. Support network. Family, friends, teachers. Mental health dips in isolation, and even when you really don’t wanna talk to anyone, all the more you should. 
7. Knowing you should reach out as soon as you face difficulties, whether it’s abt schoolwork or your mental health. 
8. Take each day as it comes. Yes, planning and thinking into the future is good, but it can be overwhelming. Just focus on tomorrow when things are stressful. 
9. Know the value of taking breaks. When you take breaks, you increase your productivity in the long run. 
10. You’re braver than you know… smarter than you think… and things usually never turn out as bad as we think! Yes, As is stressful, but so many have gone through it, and so will you :) 

All the best!"

Koufas,5,"Hello

I finished A Levels more than 5 years ago. Most of my JC life was spent on overseas school trips (thanks MOE & my school for subsidising), CCAs, non-academic experiences, and playing League of Legends

What ended up happening was that I never really revised after my lesson - I only studied what little I could for my exams. What ended up happening was that my RP never moved - it stayed the same, while all my friends started doing better and better because they were putting in consistent effort. Honestly I should have seen it coming - I started to not hand in all of my homework for all my subjects in the first half of J2 because I felt I was too busy for things and I could catch back up later. My teachers never said anything other than highlighting it - because they trusted I could make my own decisions

After one exam before J2 Jun hols I realised I needed to change if I wanted to achieve my goals. So, I started studying from 8AM to 6PM every weekday during the hols in the leadup to the exams. And after that exam, I was in school pretty much 8AM to 10 to 11PM every weekday. I remember the principal at the time walking around around 9+ when it was closer to A Levels to either help students answer Econs questions (she used to be an Econs tutor), or just to talk to us and motivate us. That really helped honestly

On Saturdays Id go NLB from 10AM to 10 to 11PM as well, and only have 1 break in between

I wish I could say that I finished my A Levels with a grade that I was happy with, in comparison to the amount of time and effort I put in the past few months. I remember tearing up and crying in front of my Lit tutors when I saw them after receiving my results because I felt like I had let them down. I know now that they really didn't think any less of me and that they were still proud regardless, but I remember feeling so bad about it

But - life goes on.

Looking back - it was completely my mistake. I had doubts, I KNEW I didn't understand the subject, I KNEW that I didn't have mastery over it. But I wasn't proactive enough in resolving my doubts

Honestly, to me, I don't think it matters how much time you spend studying. At the end of the day it matters if you genuinely understand the content and are proactive at making sure you understand it fully. Don't get me wrong - this takes a lot of time and energy as well. It takes consistent effort. Its a lot easier to pick up one paragraph of misunderstandings one week after lesson material, compared to picking up 10 paragraphs of misunderstandings scattered throughout the sem

Its like walking through a forest, and having a map. If you find something amiss in your surroundings, you can either check your map right now and spend some time clarifying where exactly you are based on your surroundings. Or, you can keep on walking in a dark, winding road - and when you realise you are well and truly far away from your destination, you spend ages trying to figure out where you are. But by then - it might be too late

I would say that I did well enough - but that was by luck and not by design. I was fortunate enough to always have been paying attention during class, so not submitting tutorial homework wasn't completely all bad because I did understand some content. I was also fortunate enough to have people as motivated as I was to do well. Even though we never arranged to study together everyday, we always knew that we were always around school or NLB. So if we wanted to have lunch or take a break, we could just find each other (even though we never arranged to do things together previously. We weren't even close honestly - we just saw each other around a lot because of how much time we spent in school)

Would I change how I did things? Yes and no - I would have spent more time consulting my teachers and making sure I knew what I was doing. But I don't regret spending all that time playing around, having fun, and enjoying my JC life. I would have done the exact same thing - but would have cut back on one of my CCAs earlier to spend more time on it

But, I would not have revised everyday etc

Would I recommend you do the same thing as me? No. Definitely not! I consider myself extremely lucky

I think its a lot safer to set aside time for yourself to enjoy things - but at the same time make sure that you're on track. You don't have to study ALL the time, but at the same time I would watch all my lectures on time and do the bare minimum of what I have to do to keep up. Honestly, tutorials are meant for you to make sure you have a good enough understanding for exams, right? So just do tutorials diligently, clarify anything you don't know, and reward yourself appropriately 

Balance is really key. Life is way too short to NOT do things we enjoy! But at the same time - we need to plan for our future as well

I guess the last thing I'd like to say is - do you REALLY enjoy Valorant? Or are you just playing it to pass the time and you don't know what else to do? If you REALLY enjoy Valorant, sure keep on playing. But if you are only playing it because that is the most immediate form of activity that can sustain your attention - I'd strongly recommend ditching it and find something else that you feel more strongly for

It took me a couple of months of staying in Diamond in League for me to realise I wasn't actually enjoying League because it was League... I was just enjoying the stimulation that came from challenging myself to win games. Now - I challenge myself in other ways that I find more meaningful - and I think my life is much better because of it :) 

All the best"
glycosylated-rna,2,not yet completed As but i think that you can enjoy your jc life while also being serious in studies. when it's time to study then study hard and be consistent or you'll have a hard time next year. it's really important to pace yourself so you don't get burnt out. you could allocate time for studying and gaming by making a weekly or daily plan and following it then the next week or day you can adjust it to suit you better. you could also study with your classmates or friends after school if you would like to.
Dibromohexane,2,new graduate here! i didn't consistently grind everyday for the past two years so yeh its defo possible to maintain a social life as long as you study smart; as long as you put in consistent effort you can take cheat days or two every week honestly. good luck!
GloxyVI,1,">to those who completed A levels, what was your journey like ? did you really like study throughout two years or is it possible to maintain a social life as long as in the end u work hard T\^T  


Wah. This one depends on what you see as having a social life. When my pals (the 6 of us) banded together to sit in a classroom and grind till 10pm every other day, it was one of the best times of my life.

Not the studying. That sucked.

But the camaraderie and to see each one of us eating together, laughing together and KO-ing on the table also. These are the kind of memories/experience you will no longer have once you start working.

It's everyday office till 5pm (WLB ftw). Then you drive to a supermarket, grab food, pick up your +1, head home then fire up Netflix. Rinse & repeat Monday to Friday. Then weekends you maybe go out with some friends or travel to another park.

The friends you have in JC will splinter into their own paths and their own lives. My closest friends are mostly doing PHDs or preparring to do their Bar exam soon. 

Those nights of eating out and grinding together were one of my fondest memories. I wish I had the same kind at my working life. Cherish those memories as you won't get them back."

CuddlesInTheory,65,"I'm sorry you're going through this. It must be rough having everything you know changed like that. 


I'm in somewhat the same boat. My mother has been dissatisfied with her current situation possibly for years now, but it's just recently that I've really realised the extent of it.


Her OPSEC is, pardon my French, fucking dogshit so she will constantly pass me her phone to ask me to do something while she has tabs open googling how to find male prostitutes in Singapore and shit like that.


I know for sure she's at least communicated with someone and exchanged similar messages, though thank fucking God I haven't seen them for myself. She basically admitted it to me after asking if I could lend her my NS allowance to transfer to 'a soldier in the Middle East in the middle of the war'.


Maybe I'm not as upset as I should be because it's a scam. Somehow I'm more upset she's falling for such obvious shit than the act of trying to cheat. I never really felt like my parents were ever that close, like that feeling that they got married and had kids because that's what you're supposed to do. So by all means, she can do whatever she want, and I really would be all for her divorcing if it wasn't the fact she can't survive on her own because of how dependant she is financially.


I'm not telling my father or anyone in my family because I've got enough on my plate and I'm not inviting more stress for myself when I'm at home. I'd recommend they go for therapy but I don't think they believe in it."
kazouku,35,"I WENT THROUGH THE EXACT SAME THING. My mom and my dad end up having a huge fight and she ended up in the hospital. luckily it wasn’t anything serious and she was discharged from the hospital pretty quickly. It got to a point where my distant relatives had to come and intervene. Now both my parents aren’t talking to one another and it really really sucks.

In this situation theres really not much you can do. The best thing you could do is probably to emotionally be there when your mom needs it and be more thoughtful like helping her with chores and stuff.

And for your own sanity, please don’t keep it inside. Speak to friends, teachers, etc. basically speak to people you can trust.

I hope you get through these tough times! all the best!"

maybe talk to some friends (if u hv that kind of rly close one who u think can understand u) of things get worse u may even consider asking help from teachers or even police, i mean rly in such pandemonium u hv to protect itself well. and yeah reddit is a quite nice place (at least i feel it that way) and im sure many of us would be more than willing to help as much as we can!

ForwardBed4817,7,"My dad cheated on my mum through texting too.  It can be alarming that someone you’ve trusted actually did this to you. My parents continued to work hard to maintain the marriage for both children.

Firstly, find someone you trust and can trust to talk about this matter. It would also be good if you could sit down with your mother and talk about this matter. She must be hurting a lot. 

Then again, should you feel unable to understand her problems or her troubles, seek someone older to advise. At 16, you’re young and should be concentrating on your mental health. The blow must be hard on you too.

Secondly, listen for your mother’s opinion. (I feel that you’re closer to your mum now. Also, it’s natural instinct to take sides.) You may be disgusted to find out that your father cheated. However, usually adults chooses to continue staying in a marriage in order to maintain the family. By staying together, the children suffer lesser in terms of financially and emotionally. Like you said, both your siblings are pampered so they might not like the future problems of having to live with a single parent.

Thirdly, please don’t keep anything to yourself. You need to process this healthily as possible. Adults and life are complicated. Occasionally, there’s no answers to every question you have. Some people, men and women just choose to cheat when an opportunity arises."
darksoulsisfun,2,"Well kid, here some words of advice from my own humble opinion. I have gone through a similar experience like you have.

You have seriously learnt some harsh truths about life through this episode. 1) all men struggle with lust ,sometimes ignoring the heavy consequences that come with it 2) adults are just people who have lived longer on this earth than you. Even with our life experiences we are, like anyone else prone to mistakes. 3) these terrible and tumultuous feelings u have inside you are part of growing up. You gotta deal with it.

Some people have mentioned telling your teacher or close friends. Firstly your teacher has their own lives and shit to deal with. Can they resolve your family situation for you? Probably not. Telling your close friends? sure, if they have faced something similar or else it’s just gonna be empty words of comfort if that’s what you seek.

I think there’s two options that’s in my mind right now. You can try to not let it affect your life however much u can. But I’m sure this is impossible. You might toughen up emotionally and mentally but as you mature you might start to have greater disdain for your father for causing hurt and harm to your mother (I’m assuming that she already knows since she’s behaving strangely) this was what I did, since I felt so useless at your age and whatever I did wouldn’t change a thing. My grades were affected and I withdrew into myself.

The other option which I think you should do and it’s what I would advice my younger self to do is: confront your dad rationally. Even when confronted he might reason in his head that you’re just a kid and you wouldn’t understand. However I think if he saw how much hurt and pain his actions are causing his own children since the secret is out, he might change his ways for good and stop shagging other women. If he still wouldn’t change a thing even for the sake of his own children then nothing will im afraid.

Well, anyway good luck. We all have been dealt different cards in life but you seem to have a pretty good deck to work with. Cheers buddy"

donteatbeansprouts,2,"hello! i’ll try to answer ur questions in segments

2. depending on your route, they’ll ask u diff things. for jc they’ll ask what subject/module you think you’ll struggle in (recommend to look at their subject list on their website) for poly, they’ll ask on your beliefs in lifelong learning.

3. not so sure what they look for but most of the people who got in have quite substantial work to present 😅 you can search “sit dcim” in youtube. message me for the specific candidate videos who got into the course.

4. a lot of our seniors went to varying places tbh. some did ui/ux while other did advertising,branding and campaigning for companies that require a media intern. some went mediacorp also! 

5. read up on their brochure its got a few key details id say. based off my two trimesters here its been quite fun. definitely challenging coming from a jc student w no work exp, but the classmates and work culture there is quite supportive. not a dog eat dog kinda culture. student life will be better if ur going in this year? because u’d get to experience the new huge punggol campus. i recommend practicing taking aesthetic film shots, show them that you have an eye for structure, composition that kind"

Just wanted to say that its something really difficult to manage and navigate - especially if you're an international student. Things can be really hard - and there are other people feeling that it is really difficult as well - even if they don't show it

>quite the opposite of my personality. I have severe anxiety, social occasions torture me

I would not characterise having severe anxiety as a personality. It is a legitimate challenge I would strongly encourage you to try and manage - because it can be managed. I wish I had understood this sooner myself and sought help earlier

>to get at least one of the leadership positions

How badly do you want this? If you don't really want to do this - I'd advise against forcing yourself to do this and to try working on yourself first until you're in a better position to go for something like this. I frequently bite off more than I can chew and I have always been burnt pretty badly in some way

>Been to professional help

Please don't give up. It can take time looking for the right kind of help. Everyone is unique - so the kind of help that works best has to be unique as well. But the right help can come. Sadly, we can't just receive help just like that. We need to go through the search for it as well. I would urge you to consider medication as well

As someone who has been at a place somewhat similar (not the same - but somewhat similar) to yours, and seen some friends been there and make a transformation as well, all I can say is that it takes time. But the belief that I am capable of doing more really helped me through

Sorry I can't be of more help - I wish I could be. But speaking from experience - there's only so much a random internet stranger can do other than their best at a particular moment

PlasticTourist3025,1,"what I did was to break up each lecture vid into intervals (if its very long) and take breaks in between, instead of watching a super long vid in one go.  Also if it helps, you can watch the lecture vids with your friends instead of going home to watch. I rmb in j1, there was a 4h break between the last lesson and CCA, so my friends and I would run the lecture vids on our visualiser and do the lecture tgt.  It rly made the video watching a lot more bearable for me also bc we can discuss tgt. And ofc watch at 1.5 speed hahah

I also tried to 'discipline' myself to complete the assignments/tutorial qns right after watching the lectures, so I can do them faster as the concepts are still fresh in my head, and also bc I won't be tempted to procrastinate.  

Tldr: its v normal to feel overwhelmed, you're never alone.  Just take it bit by bit and don't try to consume a huge chunk of info at once, it's quite overwhelming.  If you have questions/seriously cannot cope, just immediately your cher for extension/consult, they should understand.  Ask your smarter classmates for help too!!

Even tho ABA is based on portfolio, they still look at your marks. Without the marks, it is very unlikely for you to get in even with a stellar portfolio. If you plan to do med out of sg, pretty much only your grades matter. I spent quite a lot of time on my portfolio and didn't really see it as useful as the actual grades at the end. With that being said, if you are confident with your grades and your ability to juggle responsibilities, go for it!

Best case ask your school to let you in as a school candidate again, it seems you need another more time to catch up & might do well the 2nd round! plus, you have access to the school materials (and it’s significantly cheaper lol) 

but if the school doesn’t allow, just retake as a private candidate! i don’t really know or don’t really wanna attempt to make any guesses on why you scored 41 (and i’ll respect your privacy to not share with us why) but i feel you deserve a 2nd shot at A levels! all the best OP, please reconsider all options (including Poly) before making a decision!"

swjs00,128,"Sorry to hear that youre going through this. However, moving out is no easy feat. Rent is sky high, and you might be taken advantage of or cheated if you trust the wrong person. A more feasible option imo for a student is to:

1. Stay in school to study until late at night (for as long as the school allows) and on weekends (if your school permits). You could do that in a library or other public study spaces, but personally I felt safer on school grounds. I spent 6 days a wk in school
2. Your school/university offers you hall/boarding sch, you may consider taking that up too. But you should consider what the cons are (e.g. costs or other restrictions placed by the management)"

fear_no_weather,11,"Hi Op, just want to say that you are very strong and I am glad that you have realised that you need to move out early. With that, you can start planning and saving up to move out. It will definitely take some time to have enough so the best bet for now is to stay longer in school like what other posters have said as you don’t have to pay for school amenities unlike if you were to hang around outside. 

My mom was like that to me too since young. I remembered a time when I was also at home for some time (switching from JC to Poly) and faced the ridiculous experience like when you were washing your wok. I spilled a pot of rice all over the floor when I was washing it in the sink to make dinner. I quickly cleaned it up but my mom still berated me to the point that I felt so useless and not worthy of living. At that time my heart really broke but I didn’t realised that I could try to move out until years later. Till this day, even when I have moved out, I still get anxiety when I hear loud berating from Asian parents."

hengkaki,14,"The one thing you can do is not to shout back at her or retaliate verbally. It will only make her angrier and then trigger her abuse. Nothing helpful will come out of this. 

If you have a problem remembering your chores, list them down, like a reminder list, on your phone and consult it everyday.

Check with your birth father, see if you can move out to stay with him. Or other relatives, see if they can help provide you shelter. What about grandparents?

Visualise what your life will be like after you finish school and start work and can afford to live on your own. This will drive and motivate you to plod on and put up with the present unhappiness. Tell yourself it is only a matter of time, not if but when.

Existing_Rip4390,3,"i feel you girl.. my mom goes absolutely badonkers over chores especially when I was still in secondary school.. she still has her tendencies of demeaning my existence, i remember her often berating me whenever i don’t look happy cleaning up.. like am i supposed to be smiling? i have naturally downward lips so I rmb pursing my lips everytime I do chores so that my mom won’t freak out over “my attitude”

I think our mom tends to feed on the reactions we give them and I figured that out very early when I was younger (I’m 20F now) i am sorry if this isn’t the advice you want because I’ve seen on other comments that you do have trouble keeping your emotions within yourself, but honestly it’s your best shot right now. like what others say, just find reasons to stay out real late, you’re 17 so you might be gg poly/jc/ite, apply for CCAs! or just study at libraries or cafes heck even under hdb if no place, just to limit the time at home. HOWEVER, coming from experience, me being home late is another trigger for my mum, so whenever she asks just tell her honestly but without any tone of defensiveness(this is pertinent) because while she might wanna yell at you just for the sake of, how could she when you are being a dutiful student? 
maybe when you reach home or before you leave home,just proactively do some chores that you can handle. key word is proactively. limit the chances of her scolding you for chores. think of it this way—you reach home, do chores real quick, mum finds you ask u where you have been, and calls you useless for not doing anything at home…. u calmly respond and “say oh ive don’t this that etc already..had cca and study session” and the woman might be in shambles trying to find shit to scold you for. 

basically, I wish I could provide more bold advice but trust me when I say that it takes a lot of courage and strength to live with someone so abusive—in your case, verbally AND physically. my close friends always thought I should speak up but deep down I know that it’ll worsen things. so I keep it within myself as much as it hurts and as much as it’s frustrating. but it truly makes things better. there won’t be a back and forth anymore. no arguments, just her yelling at you, it sucks, I knkw but I learnt to block it out and I realised the benefits far outweighs having to deal with arguments.. hope this helps OP! you’re a strong girl <3"

ronshaworlds,2,"Hi OP, your mother is very abusive and I want to say that growing up with someone like this is a nightmare. It's definitely not your fault that you lose control of your emotions easily - a lot of people in your situation would become like this too.

However, as you have already noticed for yourself, even though losing control of your emotions easily is not your fault, it's definitely not good for yourself in any way. I am very impressed that you can realize this at such a young age.

Like others have said, it is important that you practise ignoring your mother and her shenanigans - keep in mind that ignoring won't always work though, sometimes, to get a reaction out of you, your mother might resort to really extreme words or actions. I have an abusive father, and he would do that to me and my mother. 

Other than reducing interactions and ignoring, you also need to really emotionally detach from her as well and lower your expectations that she might change for the better etc. So long as your mother sees nothing wrong with her actions, she will not change. I have a friend that kept hoping that her mother would change, despite no evidence that her mother even felt sorry about anything, and in the end my friend would be devastated emotionally each time her expectations fell flat.

You are strong and smart, and I wish you good luck in life."

She is f&*n immature. Dah tua masih bodoh, ah you see my Malay come out.

This is my message to you. None of it was your fault. You are right to want to move out. Eventually you will! So in your capacity, find the people outside of your home and make them your support system. True friends will come through and listen, maybe even willing to let you stay with them. You can also seek professional help provided by school, government or private orgs. This abusive treatment of you from this woman is UNHEALTHY and NOT normal. I wish you all the best.

MadElmoInSG,2,"I'm not an expert, but can you try to manage your own emotions. Manage yourself to manage her.

If she acts up, don't raise your voice and react. Instead, calm down and respond nicely.

Example from the wok incident. She said don't wash if you not happy, you got upset and end up both screaming at each others and things escalated.

Instead of talking back with a unhappy tone, calm yourself down, and just normal tone say 'I'm sorry, but I cannot help it the soap makes things slippery.' then try to minimise. If the dishes are soaped up n very slippery causing all the noise, how about soap up fewer and raise off first. Or even soap and rinse off 1 at a time. Waste water n time, but we're trying to reduce something here isn't it?

No matter how angry she is, you got to keep your cool and calm down, count to 10 if you have to.
When you join in with a heated emotion, things escalated. However, if you keep your cool and stay calm, she can flare all she want, but without your participation, she may probably stop after a while."

Remember that your human as well and your emotions aren’t to be neglected. 

Another option would be when university comes, you can invest in staying in a dorm while studying, although you definitely have to work part-time but rent is prob like $600-$700 per month for dorms. Getting scholarship or anything should lessen the tuition fees too."
VegetableStrategy967,1,"Hello! I can say that I was in a very similar situation, I understand how hard it was to live with someone that you are supposed to be the closest with, yet is the person that you most want to be away from. I have finished school, and have found a place to rent outside, and it did wonders for my mental health. I would however, advise against moving out and trying to be independent at a young age - you are going to make yourself more handicap by utilising the resources that you have now just to be away from her. I would recommend focusing your energy on moving out from the house instead, spending more time away from her as she deemed legitimately possible, and overall just maintain the facade for as long as possible. This is probably just a general overview of how you could deal with the situation at home, you most likely have to also come up with healthy coping methods to remain sane for the time being.

Since you are a girl, there aren't much safe places to stay out either, however I can recommend university campus, NUS utown area has 24/7 Starbucks which you can use to stay at / common places that you can go to if you really need a safe place."

Eseru,1,"Hi OP, your family is definitely abusive, and are training you to accept abusive relationships in the future. I would suggest removing yourself from the house as soon s you can.

One option is to go to your nearest family service center and ask for a referral to a girls' shelter or hostel. Organisations like the YWCA run dormitories for girls up to the age of 21 I believe, and the fee is like $50 a month. That can be waived depending on the circumstances. 

They are meant to provide shelter and a stable environment for girls from abusive homes or have nowhere to go. These places only take in referrals from the FSCs, and there's no harm exploring your options with them.

Not all parents deserve love and respect from their children, and it sounds like your mother is one of those. Do your best to ignore what she says about you - you know you are better than that - until you can leave and go no contact."

cosmic_shroomx,1,"helloo, just thought of giving my 2 cents.. after reading a lot of the comments and your updated post i think you’ve made the decision to stay for now, so if you dm i’ll share what’s worked for me (my situation is not the same but i can relate to alot of what you said) to help me not lose my cool. 

1.  do NOT EVER give in to those stupid, >!intrusive!< thoughts. i don’t think i need to elaborate but it does only harm and no good. 

2. keep a low profile. try not be within her presence when she comes home from work, just do what’s expected out of you and live your life.

3. this one is pretty hard but essentially distancing yourself from her. if the scoldings and slaps have no genuine care or concern behind it,  you do not need to take it. that is abuse. so move away. don’t share personal things with her, don’t go to her with your struggles, share stories etc etc. she just has to become a person you’re living with, roommates if you will. of course it’s impossible to not talk to her at all and lose all emotion for her(she is your mother after all) sometimes the best thing is to give each other space. 

4. yelling only makes things worse so every time you have the urge to yell remember your point doesn’t become stronger then it was when you speak at normal volume. after a while she may realise she’s the only one screaming and she may stop. it’s like how when someone whispers to you, you immediately whisper back on instinct? yeah. but you have to have alot of willpower OP, and really try and keep your cool. 

5. play devils advocate. it’s (debatably) easier to accept random scoldings when “maybe she had a hard day at work”. of course, even if that was the case, you aren’t supposed to be her punching bag. but think from her shoes, you might even understand why she’s yelling at you and can avoid it next time. 

6. if she’s not a strict parent, stay out of the house as much as possible. if you’re in school then stay in school to study, go to libraries on weekends etc etc. if you’re still on hols then meet up with friends or even take solo trips, just ride a bus or something. doesn’t have to be you’re not home like 12 hours of the day for all 7 days but the less you’re at home, the less you see her, the less fights you’ll have :) and you also need a breather/distraction from time to time. 

hope this helps (and that you see it lol)  my dms are always open! to all those in similar situations, you got this, y’all will finally be free one day, just matter of when 💪💪"

-horrible work life balance (100 hours is pretty accurate)
-very hard to get into, you need to do a stem major or econ in a prestigious university (in sg, NUS is pretty good) and do very well in said course.
-network like a maniac to get certain interviews (helps if you are in a prestigious uni)
-go overseas for MBA- Wharton, HBS, Oxbridge, LSE, Insead, haas and stern come to mind.

Looking at your comment history, you've come a long way from wanting to go to Med, then CS, then IB. I'd suggest you take a good look at your skillsets and then decide which of these paths fits your skills the best, if you're determined to chase the money just like everyone else."
representationorterm,21,"No hard feelings but the other poster is not entirely correct. You don't need to major in STEM or economics to get into IB. Biz (finance) from NUS/NTU/SMU is perfectly sufficient. In fact, I would recommend you to choose biz as it's easier to keep your GPA up (you preferably need at least 3.7-3.8/4 to recruit competitively for IB). What matters more is getting relevant internship experience. It's naturally hard to get IB internships, so most people work their way up. E.g. joining finance clubs as a freshman and doing internships at family offices and then IB internships at boutique firms, etc.   


It's challenging to recruit for IB, especially bulge, but I believe that it's possible as long as you go into uni with a plan and start preparing early!"

Signal-Departure-588,1,"hihi TJ PCME student here (except i take h1 chem)

Phys department:
Honestly this entire department is just a wildcard. I take both H2 and H3 phys so i do have personal experiences with at least 2 different phys tutors outside of the phys lectures. 
Idt anyone can describe the phys department accurately because all the tutors have very different teaching styles so it really just depends on your learning style. Some tutors tend to focus more on the calculation and derivation aspect (even if it’s not tested, it’s just good to know), some focus more on the theory and all the concepts, and since the lecturer for a particular topic is also the one making the notes, the notes are also adjusted to their teaching style.

I’d say the lecture notes and resources are sufficient and good enough for you to self-study and still understand most of what’s going on without having to pay much attention to your tutors since they’re pretty self-explanatory.

OVERALL: Pray that you get a good teacher and a good class (i heard that some tutors tend to just let their classes do their own thing if that class is really just smart and independent enough)

TIP: learn to self-study and clarify any doubts with your tutors 

Chem:
I take H1 chem so i don’t really have much to go off since there’s only lectures (this year) and two lecturers.

But anyw based on my exp I think the chem department is generally very onz. Like my lecturers will assign us more HW compared to my other tutors and we sometimes have pop quizzes or time trials outside of the official lecture tests and exams. 

They really seem to care about the student’s’ understanding of the subj and will also give feedback to students during lectures/on their submitted worksheets.

I think the notes are really well organised and sometimes they also give topical summaries and lists of important definitions at the back of the notes. 

Overall: P good ig

Math:
The notes are good enough for self-studying. (that’s p much all i can say because math is math 💀) The notes also have summaries at the back and they come with a lot of tutorial questions ranked according to difficulty and additional POYO (practice on your own) questions outside of the actual revision booklets with even more practice questions. So you get a lot of exposure to the possible questions.

Econs:
I want to say that this is the best department that I know of. But like all departments, there are bound to be at least one bad/not as good teacher. The notes are amazing since everything is as concise but as detailed as possible. The lectures are fun since they always start off with a Kahoot quiz to refresh our memories, and SLS packages to do before the lecture so that we can ask questions which will then be clarified during lectures/gain some understanding of the content so that we’re not completely lost during lectures.

The lectures themselves are also really informative since the lecturers tend to sum up some of the content, or add additional information/provide analogies or wtv to make the understanding process a lot easier.

The notes also have questions (both CSQ and essay) for practice

hengkaki,30,"Probably better to walk home after school than walk to school. 

Get a good pair of shoes and start walking. If you experience pain in your joints/legs, you need to rest and recuperate. Go slow first (5km) and then increase your distance.

Walking is actually a versatile exercise. If you want to make it cardiovascular, you can increase the pace such that you are breathing harder.

To lose weight, have to cut out unnecessary sugars and carbohydrates. Eat more earlier in the day and lesser towards the evening. Going to bed hungry is not a bad thing. 

Search YT on proper way to walk and also about weight loss through walking."
AdorableJump9625,8,if u wanna slim down be in a caloric deficit cfm will one don't need think too much
estherrrrrr,6,"1. don't see anyone else answering this so im just gonna say it, not really. i guess it depends on your schedule & your course really, but at the end of the day its a 3km walk, so at least 30mins unless you're planning to brisk walk/jog & that's being generous. honestly the pedestrian route to np from clementi is quite ulu also & it's not really meant to be accessed via walking. depending on your class schedule, you might have 8am classes, and i really dont think you'll have the mental capacity to wake up so early to arrive at clementi mrt at 7am just to walk to school for class, then still have to spend the entire day in class. if you really want to do the walking, i would suggest doing it at the end of your sch days, but even then i would say that after a few weeks/months & esp in y2 y3, you'll probably get burnt out and not commit to it any more bc of school workload (but again, depends a lot on your course). the much more realistic option is walking to school from beauty world mrt instead, which is a route that many students actually take

depending on your course/school, you might end up doing a lot of walking in school anyway. eg. if you're in lsct, you could commit to always walking up the hill to class from front gate instead of taking the shortcut route. other than that, there's school gym, and there's option of joining sports clubs for recreation so it's a lot less commitment. outside of those two, it's really just committing to a good balanced diet and exercising regularly outside of school. 

3. you could always bring a change of clothes with you & body spray if you have bo (pls be considerate to classmates since you'll probably be in air conditioned environments for class)

4. no

5. have you consulted doctors or dieticians? we can't really give an accurate assessment of whether this will help or not since we aren't privy to a lot of details and medical history. best thing to do if you can is to consult a professional to get their opinion on how to go about weight loss because there might be a lot of external factors affecting it such as genetics, medical history, etc. 

outside of all this, i would honestly encourage you to go to the gym if you're looking to keep fit. it probably seems daunting / intimidating but trust me everyone's there to do their own thing so no need to be afraid. if you know anyone who goes to the gym regularly, you can always ask them for advice or to even go together. once you start your year and get to know some friends too you can probably ask them to go to gym together, or maybe just go for runs together outside if you prefer that instead. anyway props to you for wanting to work on yourself and jiayous!"
elepantstee,5,"Remove fat, not muscle. That's very important. Also another thing, if you wanna lose weight, diet is equally as important as exercising. If you eat more than you lose(calories), youre not gonna see a difference in weight"

wiseweaverant,2,"Get in a caloric deficit, calculate using online calorie calculators.
Honestly speaking, it takes way too much time and effort to burn off an arbitrary amount of calories when you can just not consume it in the first place, in any case, prioritise getting food high in nutrients but low in calories.

It'll be good to have a walk in the morning, nothing too strenuous, just to be energised. However it can be tiring to walk home everyday, taking away your energy when it can be spent on much more important tasks.

You can always opt for a change in clothes if you get sweaty, otherwise I don't see any problem wearing dri fit shirts.

Good luck in your fat loss journey!"
Eurito1,2,"No point walking for 30 min when you already will be standing on the mrt or bus and walking around campus. Shouldn't be hard to hit 10k steps a day. Anyway, you'll be too tired to walk home after class after exhausting energy in class, homework, projects, cca, etc. Doesn't make sense to carry a 3kg backpack, walk 30 min and be sweaty and smelly and go into a packed MRT. 

**Most important way to lose weight is diet. Not cardio.**

> Everyone should do some form of cardio; swimming, walking, running, hiking, playing a sport, whatever. The point I’m trying to impress upon you is that most people resort to ‘cardio’ when trying to lose fat but it’s of the least importance when changing your body composition is the goal.

You could start off with calculating your BMR using an online BMR calculator and track your calorie intake using MyFitnessPal app. However tracking calories isn't that easy so if you feel lazy to do so honestly the best way to go around it is to completely cut out sugary drinks, snacks etc and cut out carbs from your diet. Could also do 2 meals a day rather than the normal 3 meals daily.  


Tbh, I think it would be better to walk after school as the last thing you'd want is to go to your classes feeling sluggish due to fatigue after a long walk from Clementi MRT to NP"
That-Measurement-932,1,"If your goal is to lose weight or fat,you should be in a choleric deficit which means you are some amount of calories less than your maintenance calories.Maintenance calories is the amount of calories you need to maintain your body fat.For example, my maintenance calories is about 1600 calories every day so the caloric deficit that I chose to follow is 500 calories below my maintenance calories.so I eat about 1200 calories.The amount of calories you choose to reduce should in a range of 200-500 calories below your maintenance calories.Some people do cardio that is not very physically demanding like walking only.You are highly recommended to track the amount of calories you eat everyday and it’s okay to have one day when you can eat whatever you want(Try to binge eat).It is very important to stick to the diet so maybe the first few weeks you eat about 200+ calories below your maintenance calories and then progressively increase the amount of calories you reduce.Your should eat food that are high in protein and a bit of carbohydrates and fats.Eating food that is rich in protein makes you full longer as it takes a lot of time to digest the protein.Good luck!!!"
math_dydx,11,"One factor to consider is the proportion of Business degree students taking the various specialisation, from marketing, HR to finance. The thing about starting salary is that it is very industry/job role dependent. It is probably fair to say that finance job roles generally pay better than marketing and HR roles? And so the proportion of each uni business student in taking what specialisation would have affected the percentage of their uni business graduates go into what kind of career roles. Hence, lumping all business specialisation salaries together as 1 business degree really can't say much, some specialisation pull up the numbers, while some other specialisation pull down the numbers.

[https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1tVlxRwv5mSaGIdsdxMDcxpuAHZfgyJ20mWVVVkYuPc8/pubhtml#](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1tVlxRwv5mSaGIdsdxMDcxpuAHZfgyJ20mWVVVkYuPc8/pubhtml#) (GES Pass Ten Years)

Similarly, the NUS Faculty of Science lumps most science degree salaries together. Is the salary numbers then a fair representation of all science degrees? Then now you take a look at NTU Science degrees, which break it down by majors. We can see clearly majors like Mathematical Sciences, Environmental Earth Systems Science, Biological Sciences and Psychology are pulling the science majors' salaries up, while majors like TCM, Chemistry, and Biological Sciences are pulling down.

Even within a degree that has no specialisation or the job prospect of the specialisation in the degree is almost the same, there can be a diverse interest of graduates who want to do different kinds of jobs/careers, some will pay better in more lucrative industries or job roles, some will pay less but might be more stable like a government job. So the proportion of graduates with a degree with different interests will also affect the salary statistics of that degree. Hence, what matters actually is more of You, not the statistics of all the particular degree graduates. You in the sense of what industry/job u are going into, and what is meaningful for u to know is what this industry/job that u want to go pays how much.

And note that getting into your desired industry/job can be done via different degree paths. So even if one comes with another less directly relevant degree to the job, so long as one can get that job, one will still be paid similarly to those with the most relevant degree to the job. After all, it is the skills that u have, the portfolio that u have, and the internships u do that matter more than the degree name.

That's why take GES with a big pinch of salt. Especially when we do not have lots of other info like the proportion of business degree students in each uni choosing various specialisations. And care more about You, rather than your degree graduates' mean/median salaries, as your peers of the same degree may have different career aspirations as u and go to different jobs/industries. You can be from another degree with lower mean/median salaries, but so long as u get the job with high salaries is what matters right?

Also, do take note of the drop in academic units (AU) of many NTU Business modules:

[https://www.reddit.com/r/SGExams/comments/11ao33y/ntu\_business\_many\_modules\_drop\_from\_4\_academic/](https://www.reddit.com/r/SGExams/comments/11ao33y/ntu_business_many_modules_drop_from_4_academic/)"

besides that, you should also keep an eye out for evaluation points. most of them are actually quite intuitive and follow roughly the same pattern, so if you refer to some good essays, you'll likely be able to get the hang of it. this is v impt for A in geog bc eval will rlly push your essays to the next level!"
Dull-Unicorn,5,"Hi, current J3 here. I'll try my best to answer your questions. Please cross check in case what I provide is inaccurate.

>2. is it possible for me to do smth before uni starts and talk abt that in my ABA?

Yes, you can volunteer, apply for part time jobs, or even do some online courses after A's and include it in your ABA.

>3. if my grades surpass the IGP for the major i'm applying for, will admissions even look at my ABA? like let's say i score better + portfolio as empty as the depths of the sea and person A scores lower than me + stellar portfolio, who would be given priority to be admitted into the course?

If your RP>>IGP, you would receive direct admission. AFAIK, they will only consider ABA if your RP is close to the IGP. (Eg a few points lower/higher)

>4. any like common things ppl usually put/reccs for me to do that i can possibly talk about under ABA? like i participated in some comps but i just have 'participation' for those so is it even possible to incl that?? lmao x_x

I feel like you don't have to write solely about academic achievements. It can be from your CCAs, external activities etc, where you can link your experiences to what you learnt/your attributes/your course in mind.

But yes, you can include these if you feel that it is suitable.

>extra info: i'm q interested in studying life sciences so what?how?what do i even do to display my interest?

Work hard for A's so that your RP is more than the IGP for CHS. You can also take part in science olympiads, research programmes (may be abit late for this?), sch science competitions and even talks to show that you have a keen interest in the sciences."

Many-Investment7092,2,"i totally understand how you feel as i have been through it too… i think the main problem here is that you are feeling unproductive and thus feel like the day is “wasted” so u push back ur tasks to tomorrow. 

As such i think the best way to start this is by making ur day feel “productive”. You need not start doing homework/ revision for hours straight. Start doing small tasks that makes you feel accomplished, eg. exercising, doing household chores or even as simple as tidying ur room/ filing ur subject materials. 

Basically the goal here is to reduce phone usage :)

These small accomplishments will make you feel better and feel productive thus motivating you to start some school work too!! 

But of course, do everything in moderation, don’t burnout, i wish i could tell my olvl self last yr to spot the signs of burnout early… but since i can’t, i hope you do. All the best OP!"
scorchyflakes,2,">tips for staying focused or not using your phone because i will admit it distracts me.

Delete the apps that distracts you. That way you have lesser inclination to check your phone.

If there are some apps that distract you but you can’t delete (eg, Whatsapp just in case there’s impt sch news), just put your phone on silent and lock it away.

If you still end up checking it, you might wanna give it to someone to help you keep until you’re finished studying.

Also regarding the ‘feeling unmotivated’ thing, you genuinely can’t just wait for motivation to strike you. If it never does, are you just gonna not study?

Don’t get me wrong, I understand being burnt out is a thing. But to avoid it happening again, please remember to take adequate rest/breaks when needed!

Good luck for Os this year, OP!!"
PlasticTourist3025,1,"Hiiii OP, I think you may be feeling burnt out, which is totally normal and you don't have to feel bad/embarrassed about it.   No one is motivated to mug 100% of the time, and motivation usually comes in random bursts.  So what I would say is to take advantage of these random times when you suddenly feel refreshed and motivated, and mug v hard.

For starters you should consider the pomodoro technique (study for ~25 min intervals then take a break for 5 min).  Please don't force yourself to study for a few hrs straight (unless you're doing timed practice but even so I usually don't time myself for the whole paper), bc no normal person can focus for so long.  Also when studying, identify and focus on the things that you're unfamiliar with/are not good at.  So that your study sessions will be more focused and not draggy and repetitive.  

I personally struggle a lot with the phone problem too, but one thing I did was to place my phone in another room whenever I'm studying so I don't get tempted to pick it up when it's next to me.  I also mute my gcs and social media.  If you want, you can ask your parents/siblings to help you hide it (I won't dare to do this lmaoo)

Lastly, think about your end goal.  There's a time and place for everything. You can enjoy yourself all you want after Os, but *now* is the time to mug.  You're working hard now because you want to manifest that sexy🤪  L1R5/L1R4 that will get you into your dream school.  Your teachers and parents can do anything, but YOU are the one who's in control rn, and whatever you do next depends on what you choose to do now.  With that being said, all the best for o levels, I believe in you!!!"

Shrekismine21,1,"Hii 
Like what many said, practice is really important 
Try to practice as much as you can yeaa 
Try to revise or like recap what you've learnt in school when you come back home 
And ask your teacher for help when you don't understand smthg or if you can't figure out how to do certain topics/qns 
You still have months before the crucial period, so use it wisely and manage your time wisely ( take full advantage of time )
Merely just memorising doesn't really help a lot 
Understand what you're learning 
I mean there are some things that you might have to no choice  memorise like yk reactivity series and all but still
Understand what you learn 
Like yk it just makes everything wayyy easier 
Like trust me 
For example
For blast furnace, when you understand the process, it'll just naturally come to you 
Rather than like when you just blindly mug and don't know what's happening 

Application and key words are also very important not just in chem but sci in general so take note of that yea
When you do corrections, highlight the key words and ykyk when you revise, you'll know what you have to include in your answers 

Don't be afraid to ask your teacher for more practice
You can always approach your teacher and ask if you can get any extra materials 
And yk you can also ask them to mark it for you 


Plan your time wisely 
Don't stress a lot 
Just pace yourself properly and don't push everything to the last min

most people don’t take a minor, when you’re in Uni, you’ll be taking at least 1 major, the major is basically the degree that you’re taking

for example if you want to pursue a computer science degree, your major would be computer science, you only need to take 1 major but you can choose to take a 2nd major, but at that point you might as well just take a double degree because there ain’t much difference timeline wise

then there are specialisation, there are different specialisation for different majors for example in business ntu you can choose to specialise in banking & finance, marketing, HRM yada yada but you can only specialise in 1 field AFAIK

You can go to open houses in the different universities to enquire them about such! You’d get a more detailed and accurate answer that way."

Whether we think you will get in or not doesn’t actually predict your results! Plus it’s influenced by a number of factors, so no one will really know? 

Regarding your SAT score, 1450 should be fine. NUS requirement page states min 600 for Reading & Writing, 650 for Mathematics. (Do take note it’s minimum, so again no guarantees!) 

Here is the link: [Other High School Qualifications](https://www.nus.edu.sg/oam/apply-to-nus/international-qualifications/admissions-requirements/other-high-school-qualifications)

Grinad,6,"1. Casual wear is usually the norm. Just some t shirt, shorts/pants and shoes. lecture theatre could get a bit chilly so bring a sweater or jacket just in case. 

2. It depends on the lecturer, some talk fast, some talk slow but the things covered in lectures would be accessible to you. Lecture slides, labs, practicals and tutorials would be available on this website called politemall. politemall is this website where you access your quizzes, assessments and assignments, as well as all your notes and slides.

runningtothehorizon,1,"Depends on posting (medical vs surgical), number of calls, number of weekend rounds, how good is the manpower for that posting. Supposed to have a maximum 80 hour work week but this can be exceeded especially if a lot of calls/weekend rounds/poor manpower.

No long breaks during houseman year. Can take annual leave subject to posting limits.

Calls are not compensated by a long break. For example with a 30 hour call: would start work 6am day 1, work until 12pm day 2, go home and sleep, back at work 6am day 3."
attackcorg,1,"so ok i was a PGY 1 some time back, so take with a pinch of salt. as mentioned by the other commenter, how many hours you work depends on the hospital, department, how is the manpower, how many calls you have etc. you're supposed to have max 80 hours week, but in certain specialties like surgery-based ones, this may be exceeded. when i did a particular surgical specialty i rounded every day for two months until the department decided that maybe i should take a weekend off somewhere along the way because i was making them look bad by reporting my hours honestly. (the hospital admins will ask you to alter your numbers, though i know this in the context of residency, where if you bust the 80 hour cap and you report it honestly, there are repercussions on the training program).

long breaks do not exist when you start working, unless you take no-pay leave. there is a maximum allotment of how many days you can take for annual leave depending on the the length of the posting. as an estimate, my postings were 3 months each as a HO, and the leave allotment was something like 5 days + the weekend, but these days postings are 4 months so i am not quite sure how many days you will get now. when you're an MO and your postings are 6 months each, i think AL per 6 months is something like 14 days? if you become a resident, there's a leave of absence allotment on top of factoring annual leave (essentially of how many days in a posting you can be away, which factors in annual leave, MC, family care leave as well as reservist). this sucks absolute balls, as most male residents will tell you because it means that you can't take annual leave without busting the leave of absence cap during periods of reservist. (not a dude, don't have personal experience with this, have listened to griping though.)

some special postings e.g. SICU in Anaesthesia for certain hospitals have a cool arrangement where you get the next day off after doing a call (called post post call), but in most places after doing a full 30 hour call, you only get the day of post call off and then you're back to work again."

Many-Investment7092,4,"to be honest, it is a bit too late to request for hmt now, you shld have done it last yr after your EOYs, most teachers would not accept someone who has been scoring As and Bs, maybe if u were an A student, they might consider, but seeing how u normally score A and B, what makes u think the teacher would accept u into hcl when hcl is considered a h1 subject at alvls. 

but if u are really that desperate, do approach the HOD and make a request, they prob will judge ur ability through a compo/ exam so do be prepared, a disclaimer tho…hcl is really harder than it looks, don’t just do it cuz u want 2 bonus points when ur foundation is not strong"
alwaysleeping_,3,i took hmt for the past 4 years in secondary school.(currently a j1) hmt is very diff from mt it is quite a big jump and given that u will be taking hmt olevel next year it is very risky as you will be required to learn many diff things like our 2 min oral presentation and for paper 2 we have editing and summary which differs a lot and are harder compared to the mt paper. h1 chi is easier than hmt and tbh it’s kinda late to start learning at sec 3 it will be more stressful and harder to cope as ur peers are ppl who learned hmt since sec1. hmt students mostly get A in exams so with a B it shows ur foundation arent tht strong and unless u have confidence highly not advised to transfer

OK so I've just received an email around 13 hours ago by this new person called Annie Baker saying that my scholarship application was in fact not successful (pensive) because I am already a student enrolled in a university, which makes sense so I don't blame them for it.

I mean, yeah sure, I would say that this email is written with a lot more legitimacy. But who the hell is Michelle and why is there an Annie and are they even related or is Michelle just some scammer? So here are the things that I have taken note of:

1. her link to edu-capital website actually links you to [https://celebritysummit.org/](https://celebritysummit.org/) 
2. ""michelle"" from the initial ""you got the scholarship!!"" email uses [michelle@edu-capital.org](mailto:michelle@edu-capital.org) while annie uses [annie@educapitalfund.org](mailto:annie@educapitalfund.org) 
3. it was pointed out that jotform (the site applicants used to apply for the scholarship) takes the applicant's IP address as well as other identities that you have written to submit your application.

Coding is often required for the different IS modules. The common languages include Python, Javascript, PHP, which are the basics for many of today's digital projects. There are also opportunities to learn other languages such as Java in Object Oriented Programming or in Computer Science modules that you can take. There will not be a lot of Maths but good to know some basics such as modulus, log etc for Computational Thinking and writing some algorithms.

SMU IS course has a good mix of projects and exams. Exams wise it is a written paper which tests you on the concepts application and even spotting/correcting errors. There are also lab tests and projects where your skills are put to the test.

fixed that for you!

AGC is also quite rough tbh

But on a more serious note, there are some smaller firms that do care about work-life balance and do treat their junior associates better. But the pay is definitely on the lower side (5Kish) compared to your typical large name firm who can afford to pay higher starting salaries. You likely wont find them in CBD though

You could also consider in-house legal counsel. A hefty number of lawyers spend a few years in a law firm before jumping ship to in-house. Work-life balance is better and you get paid well too

You could aim to start at legal counsel as well - some banks like OCBC have even offered students not studying law to fund their JD and then come back because they liked the candidate so much despite the candidate not doing law. But ehh think I may have heard that the attitude towards people who start directly as in-house is probably not ideal

You could also just study law and then do something else after that, its not like Law = go be lawyer. Nowadays it doesnt really matter what you study anymore as long as you have the skills and drive"

lastly, once youre left w your options from elimination of what you don’t qualify for / what you dislike, consider what youre good in !! following GES is practical, but what if it’s something that you arent good at? eg. not everyone is fit for CS, so going in their blindly just for the $$ is just a good way to burnout and feel demotivated when u see the high achievers and those who truly have passion for it"
stressedintern12345,38,"I think the argument for choosing based on interest is because if you’re interested in something, you’ll feel more motivated to work hard and do well (leading to better job prospects), vis-a-vis dragging yourself through a course you have 0 interest in and getting wrecked by the bell curve. 

I think this is quite a dichotomous take. Ofc some people can force themselves to do things they hate and be good at it but not everyone can. On the flip side, you may be very passionate in a subject but there’s just a limited job market for that in SG. Realities of inflation, rising cost of living etc may set in and you may lose interest for that course

Imo both passions and practicality should be a consideration. For me I chose my current course because I don’t despise it and it has good job prospects. Do I have a burning passion for my course? Not really. But I guess it helps to pay the bills and I don’t feel like clawing my eyes out having to do it everyday."

The point is pick something that plays to your strengths and then master it. With mastery comes confidence, and in time you may come to love the subject as well."
paper_sloth,15,"Hello OP, aspiring future doctor here (sounds kinda cool which is why I say it ngl).

Yeaa I can totally relate because I didn't have any passions last year when I applied medicine and fumbled the interviews.

You cld say my passion is/was binging anime/manga/manhwa until after the sun rises.

But after going to NS and thinking abt why I failed my interviews, I decided to grow up a little and be more realistic.

If you can't draw, you may not be able to make money as a digital artist, let's say.
Everyone's got their own strengths.
I would say mine is overthinking and writing stuff like this.

What's my REALISTIC passion?
I guess it'd be psychiatric work or therapy, I wanna become a mental health professional.
Over time I've helped many friends get over their mental hurdles or stand on their own two feet again, and it's very fulfilling.
All of this is by chance.
I only became aware of psychiatry because my bmt sectionmate confided in me about how he was addicted to xanax/anti-depressants and his psychiatrist was bad for over-prescribing.

If you ask me about interest, it's not anything grand.
It's seeing that person doing something cool, and thinking that it's cool.
That's interest.
If you wanna take it a step further, sometimes you also consider the possibility of learning to do it.
To learn whatever instrument your friend plays well, or learn to dance like that, or tell jokes like that.
You'll notice how commonplace interests can be.

You also need to find your greatest strength.
What can you do that no one else can?
That makes you unique. 
That makes you valuable.
Then people will line up to pay for your work, I'd say.

Passion can be so petty sometimes!
My friend is also re-applying med because of a petty rivalry with his older sister (law student).
It's petty, but it's good for his ego. I support it, blue lock style.

Anyway if you come up with nothing still, I suggest you opt for a generalist course. It leaves you with options after you graduate, and gives you more time to think as you study.
Examples I can list off the top of my head:
- Com Sci/Com E
- Engineering (in general)
- Business/Accountancy
- Economics
- Pure Sciences/Maths
- Psychology (clinical is actl very hard to get into, so some even go corporate and become HR managers, marketing analysis and stuff)

There are more but hopefully this is a broad enough range.


So do think about this.
And also think about your life, and what you wanna do with it.
It's YOURS, after all.

I was asked by an interviewer: ""What do you want to achieve in 50 years?""

I was stunned.
I started doing math, like
50 years is a LOT.
If I'm lucky I'll retire then.

But I'm not so lofty as to say I wanna help the world achieve equality (I said this in my interview like a blurr sotong because my interview suggested this answer).

No, I'm just a dude.
I wanna have a family, buy a house, and be rich enough to live comfortably.

When I die, I wonder where my money will go.
To charity, maybe.
To my family definitely.

I'm getting overly philosophical but
What am I gonna leave behind?
Who am I gonna leave behind?

How do I make it so that it's not too sad when I die?
Idk bruh, I guess by living as best I can.

But one step a time
Apply first
Worry about offer
Get job
Get husband/wife/non-binary partner
Get house
Do wtv you want
Die peacefully at an old age (hopefully)

If you're still reading this wtf go fill out the form deadline is cominggg (or maybe it already passed shag)
Atb with your apps guys"
ThaEpicurean,8,"Yep. The education system (for jc students) produces generalists who are good at their various subjects but not exceptional in any subject (except for the minority with a h3 subject). Furthermore, most of us picked jc most likely because we left sec sch with no particular interest in any field (hence rejecting the prospect of poly). 

Jc isn't exactly a place for students to ""develop interests"" so people like us just graduate and end up feeling clueless as to what to do next. The GES then becomes a tool for us to pick our uni degrees because picking a degree with a higher median starting salary is more rational than throwing a die and picking a degree randomly."
avocadohater3000,12,"That's fine. For some, their career is their life. For others, it's hobbies, travelling, family etc.

If you aren't really keen on anything, just pick a major that can land you a decent-paying job, and one that you can perform well in based on your strengths.

Happiness and satisfaction doesn't have to come from your career. Just get money from it, and use the money to do things you like."
GloxyVI,9,"I'd say, do something where you believe you won't get crushed by your peers.

GES is good in that even if you do grad with let's say Merit or 3rd, you'd at least have a likely higher chance of earning more than other courses of equivalent honours.

My two cents is to do something that has the widest job possibilities in order for you to decide when you graduate. Economic environment changes very rapidly in 4 years. If you aim for the money, and it doesn't materialize, you'd kick yourself wondering what happened.

But if you have a wide array (hah pun intended) of options, then you can just switch industries/domains easier.

Also, please ah. Don't anyhow do Arts or something fluff then later complain you can't get a good paying job. Singapore is run as a business. It doesn't care if you are passionate in A/B/C/D/E, if it is not needed, it is not needed."
Professional-Elk737,2,"I’ve found that people are really open to meeting with students to discuss what they do. I have a cold email template (you can also customize something with chatGPT) and find people on Twitter or LinkedIn. In high school I was obsessed with sports so I met with people that worked in athletic departments and sports broadcasting. I learned from those conversations that careers are hard to get into and limiting for skill transferability. Ask questions about the types of problems they work on, the work life balance, and what the day to day looks like.

AnonymousScroller124,1,What’s ges
fireflight13x,1,"Take a year out to do internships and delay uni. There's no harm doing that to explore possible areas of interest if you're not sure yet. Better to do that first and get a clearer idea and some working experience and then study a course that you're interested in, rather than to jump into a uni course that you'll pay thousands for and aren't certain you'll enjoy. That year of experience will be valuable in any case. And no employer cares if you enter the workforce ""one year later"". It will all be moot after 3 years anyway when work experience counts for more.

The important thing about interests is that they may point to possible skillsets or potential that you could develop. Talking with people who have some years of experience working can sometimes be helpful to identify those and may give you ideas of where to explore. The years of experience means that people might have heard about or met people who have jobs even completely unrelated to theirs but that may relate to your incubation directly or laterally, and they may bring that up. E.g. I don't like Kpop N and Chinese movies/novels at all and work in a completely unrelated industry, but I might end up suggesting things like ""why don't you explore possible roles in media production?"" or ""it looks like one of your strengths is Mandarin, why don't you explore project management or policy-making work that works with Mandarin-speaking teams?"" Or I may ask you something like ""what is it about K-pop/Chinese movies/novels that you like? Is it the technical aspect? The creative aspect?"" These conversations may give you a bit more of an inkling what direction you might want to head in.

Part of this whole process when you are young is a bit of getting to know yourself and your interests, curiosities, and inclinations better. Even if you only find those out later on after you graduate, there are ways to pick up skillsets that can help you to navigate towards doing something that you find fulfilling."

For the job prospects of a math degree, u can refer to my post 2 years ago (link above), the relevant part I copy and paste below.

<<<

First up. I will talk about job prospects of a math degree graduate. Look at “Mathematical Sciences” in the following link:

[https://www3.ntu.edu.sg/careertracks/be\_inspired\_college\_science.html](https://www3.ntu.edu.sg/careertracks/be_inspired_college_science.html)

It gives a detailed breakdown on the percentage of NTU Math graduates who went to take on jobs in various sectors and their common job titles. Personally, I have friends who graduated from NTU Math, that went on to be:

1. Statistician in Department of Stats (DOS), Singapore, where he analyses govt available data to help govt formulate policies
2. Data/AI Engineer in Defence Science and Technology Agency (DSTA) where he write codes to crunch big data and use artificial intelligence to gain insights to govt data. He was promoted to senior engineer in his 3rd year in DSTA
3. Statistician at Casino Regulatory Authority of Singapore where he analyses new games to roll out in Singapore casino to ensure fair casino game using statistical techniques
4. Cryptanalyst at CSIT where he analyses the security of websites to prevent cyberattacks
5. Researcher at Defence Science Organisation (DSO) where he embark on interesting research projects involving lots of math/data/AI to help in defence of Singapore
6. Further studies for a research career (PhD in Math, Economics, Finance, Computer Science) - There are quite significant number that went to further studies. This is because research at PhD level in many quantitative disciplines (Math, Economics, Finance, Computer Science, etc.) requires lots of math, and a math degree gives you a strong math foundation to do advance research in many quantitative disciplines. I know of peers who are doing Phd in US universities and local universities.

As can be seen above, there are many job prospects for NTU math grads, and common job prospects are stated above. In this age of AI and big data, math degree is one of the best degrees out there to prepare for AI and big data career, as computer science is actually a kind of applied math. Thus, math degree should not be tough to find a job, with so many AI and big data jobs out there, even now when the economy is pretty bad. Above also shows that math degree does not just end up becoming math teacher in schools, which many people have misconception of a math degree.

\>>>

You can refer to my comment (link below) to a post, where in the comment I compared the difference between NUS Physics with Second Major in Math Versus NTU Double Major in Physics and Math.

[https://www.reddit.com/r/SGExams/comments/u2ltwz/uni\_ntu\_or\_nus\_physics/i4knq5t/?context=3](https://www.reddit.com/r/SGExams/comments/u2ltwz/uni_ntu_or_nus_physics/i4knq5t/?context=3)

If you are interested in both math and physics and wanting to learn rigorously how math is used in physics, then the specially curated NTU Double Major in Physics and Math will be very suitable for you.

Ok_Plastic1912,43,"I was in a similar position as you but ultimately went with nus, no scholarship but don’t regret it. The environment is indeed competitive but not in the sense that people wont help each other, or intentionally snake each other. It’s more like people are always doing more, getting internships, doing side projects, TA, etc. It pressurises you to do more too, which to an extent is a very good thing. I think it’s always better to be small fish in a big pond. Keeping to the same analogy, if you are a small fish in a big pond, you can always keep to your own area if you don’t want to pressure yourself too much, but if you are a big fish in a small pond, it’s harder to “transfer pond” if you want to grow more.

seriousghost,2,"NUS CS has far far far better curriculum and their graduates are going to better places for internship / full time in general.

NUS also seems to have a better culture for students who aspire to be great at computer science / software engineering."
hecatevine,2,"NUS for the network, connection and programs that it can offer. Honestly I feel like the education there can be quite holistic (outside of your curriculum) and the opportunities for overseas programs are much more (not just exchange programs). If you wanna go CS u might be interested in NOC also, and NUS provides a lot of resources for that program. If you’re not tight on cash in your family, think long term. But NUS has a lot of bursaries and stuff that you can apply if your results are good/you need financial help. So yeah anyway go to open house and talk to seniors who are in the schools to learn more. Cheers!"
math_dydx,5,"Did u consider studying NTU Double Major in Math and CS? With your RP, you should have no issue getting into this double major, which will give u a stronger edge over those with a single major in CS and further stand out among the many CS grads. Whereas, for NUS side, it might be competitive to get into any double/second major with CS. Hence, if u compare NUS CS and NTU CS, I am sure many will suggest go NUS CS. But if u compare NTU offers u double major CS and math, against NUS CS single degree alone, then it is much harder to tell which is preferable, and depends on what you want to learn in uni.

CS and math are intrinsically related. You can refer to my post last week (link below), on the module comparison of the NTU CS degree and the NTU Math degree. There is a lot of overlap in the things u study. So as well study a bit more by taking the double major (same 4 years as a single major) to enhance your mathematical foundation in CS, and open doors to even more career opportunities.

[https://www.reddit.com/r/SGExams/comments/114hy6r/how\_similar\_is\_a\_computer\_science\_degree\_to\_a/](https://www.reddit.com/r/SGExams/comments/114hy6r/how_similar_is_a_computer_science_degree_to_a/)

No need to worry about the NTU STARS Course Registration system. They have improved it over the years. It is just a small issue on course registration, which should not deter u to join a degree program just because of these small admin issues. Even if it may be cumbersome the admin issue, what's more important is what you learn in your degree program, not the admin part.

PS: Small fish in big pond or Big fish in small pond. This is an important issue actually. NUS CS probably has a bigger pond, and u will be a smaller fish there. Sometimes being a big fish in a small pond allows u to grab all the opportunities on offer in the uni (pond) easier and score first-class honours easier. And at least local companies don't really care u come from NTU/NUS/SMU/SUTD. They care what skills u have, and what internships u do. u can study at NTU and do your own outside coding stuff/portfolio/internships and job prospects/outcomes will also be similar to another uni."

And I'm sure with 88.75, u'll be able to attain the top scholarships for both universities (Global Impact for SMU and Global Excellence/STEP for SUTD). Just hope that your portfolio can justify it as well"

Public-Research,1,"My own take as a NTU BCG undergrad:

If you care about prospects then I recommend NUS CS or NTU BCG (or any double degree programmes). Star wars isn't an issue as you get your mods registered for you; it only matters if you want to add or drop modules ie not follow the recommended curriculum. In terms of the teaching, yes we usually skip live lectures and tutorials for some mods as they don't help much. You can get by with pre recorded lectures and suggested solutions which most mods provide. 

A huge con for NTU imo is the ICC curriculum. You have to take 7 compulsory mods on topics such as writing, ethics and wellbeing that you cannot su (and it's pretty poorly conducted). Be ready to have your gpa pulled down unless you are some god who can miraculously ace all of them.

In general, if you can NTU scholarship, you can definitely consider BCG. If I were you I would try applying for external scholarships and go for NUS CS."

Most humanitarian initiatives and NGOs are volunteer-reliant and if universities outright said they no longer care about an applicant's community involvement, most people probably wouldn't give a damn about the underprivileged and choose to not volunteer at all. 

Instead, we could practice the use of ""hooks"" in admissions, like US colleges do. Things like being low-income, living in a single-parent household, having a lifelong disability etc. gives you an advantage over other applicants.

It evens out the playing field."

danadandandanseaweed,2,"Student life wise I do think is quite vibrant now since there isn't covid19 restrictions anymore. We recently had our mental health week, diversity week etc. So I do think is quite vibrant. 

NUSC's CCA are actually called Interest groups. We actually have about 25 sports IGs and 38 sociocultural IGs now. In terms of the listing we do have a telegram channel for it but it isn't open to the public. You can ask me if there is a specific IG you want to join and I can check if it exists? If not you can actually start your own IG."
studycookie,1,"not an NUSC student but I watched their most recent webinar on their youtube channel because I was curious: 

they do have IGs apparently, and you can still be part of the CCAs in NUS as an NUSC student. not sure about the culture either since last year’s NUSC intake were the first batch so it’s quite hard to find out unless somehow you knew one of them?"
quest_summer,1,"Hi there,  
I am a Computer Science applicant considering whether to indicate my interest in applying to NUS college. I have a confusion: Is the application of NUS college and the regular NUS application separate? Or, asking differently: Will applying to the NUS college affect my regular application to NUS? Based on what I learned, the application to NUS college is way more competitive than the regular application to NUS. Let's say; my profile is strong enough to get admitted into NUS as a CS major but not competitive enough to succeed in my NUS college application. Would my indication of 'interest in the consideration of NUS college' make my application unsuccessful? Although my first choice is NUS college + CS major; however, a CS major without NUS college is way better than an unsuccessful application. Do you have any suggestions?  
Your answer and clarification are much appreciated.   
Thanks and regards."

You complain about having a bad GPA in ite and yet say NS is going to waste 2 years of your life ?

Not trying to sound like an elitist but holy fuck - 1.8 ??? You need to be realistic and not look for comfort from these bots and face the TRUTH I.e you suck in academics and have wasted your own opportunities during your YOUTH! No one is to blame ! Whatever fucked up choices led you so where you are now and you should STOP AND REFLECT. WTF in the world you have been doing and rectify when necessary. Graduating from ite and getting their degree is realistically not well perceived in fact, downright useless. The majority of the population knows the infamous perspective of ITE students.

Not to willow in self-pity! In regards to your emotional health, everyone is experiencing some problems of their own! You think you were the first student who was “ depressed “?

honestly right we tend to get overwhelmed more easily when he have so many pathways to take in life. i suggest making sort of a timeline of all the possible choices you have i.e. retaking your course, wsdip, ns, etc. and then listing the pros and cons. i believe that'll help you make the best decision after weighing out all your choices 

i don't know about what interests or hobbies you might have either, but know that many people in singapore don't just rely on meritocracy to get a job that they like. i know of some people that dropped out midway during their education, and still score their dream job after lots of hard work outside of school.

ite is definitely not the end, no matter what gpa u get or what other sgeans tell you. we might not have made the right choices prior, but going forward you only need to strive to be better la. as long as you know you're making progress, match with others' pace and set your own speed. in the end life isn't a race but a marathon"

Also, vpn may break down at times and only some of them support you to play videos e.g. mine costed 10 sgd a month which is not bad, not to mention the strict censorship.

NaAlOH4,9,"Was from low tier JC, still scored all A's except B for PW (but that's on me bcos of oral presentation, majority of my classmates scored A).

It is very possible to score well in low tier JC. Out of all the subjects, PW and GP is probably slightly lower chance but still very possible. It is also possible to learn the whole JC syllabus on your own, given the online resources available nowadays, so subjects like physics, chemistry and math do not depend on which JC you are from (tho having better teachers makes it easier to score).

Your O level score proves you can do well academically (sure some might say A Levels > O levels, but tbh most of the content are quite similar). When I first entered JC (my o levels were p shit btw), my aim was 82RP (for NTU accountancy), but as time went by, my expectations became higher and higher.

The hardest part about scoring well in a ""low tier jc"" is that you really need to have self-discipline. My classmates were chilling in Y1 and some of them managed to do well in A's but there were some who didn't manage to catch up.

I suppose you are still a J1, so you've got plenty of time to meet your goals. During J1, I tryhard-ed while everyone was slacking, so during exam periods, I was the one chilling while everyone was busy revising."

I asked my advisor if SAT would help in the application for universities in Australia and this is the reply she gave me: 

“it would be on a case by case basis, depending on the uni and popularity of program. “

However, if your grades aren’t enough to get into interviews and you choose to retake A’s (then getting >87.5), you can use grades the next time you apply. The lowest rp I know of in med is around 82 because of the person’s national level award. And as for community work, I don’t really think it works if you just spam hours? It has to be something relatively impactful and something you’re  passionate about which should show when the interviewers ask you about it. Hopefully this helps"

I know you're an [introvert](https://www.reddit.com/r/SGExams/comments/10ddowi/regretting_my_eae_so_much) but transferring to NYP is not going to solve your problem. All polys have presentations. Just that RP has slightly more. Anyway, it's good to have more presentations and class participation. When you participate in class, you become an active learner instead of passive learner that gets distracted and zones out. Communication skills is highly valued in the workplace. You can be the smartest person in the company but if you don't know how to talk, how to communicate your ideas, how to convince others to listen to you, then you're screwed. Poly is a good place to step out of your comfort zone. Don't think that just becaise you're an introvert, you can't speak up in class or won't be able to present well. You can do it. The vast majority of people are also introverts so don't worry. You'll learn from others and others will learn from you. You will learn important life skills like speaking up, asking questions and overcoming your fears. You will learn how to work in a group. All these skills are very important in the working world. It's good to learn it now. 

So just relax now. Reframe your thoughts on RP to be positive. Poly is a good place to experiment, to try new things, to hone your skills."
somerandomacclol,3,"1. RP isn't that bad. If you go in with a bad mindset then you are going to do badly.
2.  You shouldn't have EAE'd to RP as a back up if you wanted to go to other polys in the first place. You are taking a spot of someone who could've gotten in, and I'm pretty sure when you DAE they have your records too. It wouldn't bode well for the people to see you transfer to the same course, just in a different polytechnic.
3. I dropped out of poly prior to RP and I'm telling you straight up that you are at the bottom of the barrel as a poly dropout. It's O-Level students > ITE students > A level students > Poly dropouts if I remember correctly.

More often than not, they wouldn't accept you transferring courses (when you're in the same course) because ""you don't like RP"". 

I know a lot of seniors that have went to uni through RP, as another commenter said, you don't need to be extroverted to do well here. I am pretty introverted but I'm doing very well here. Go in with the mindset of doing well, not with the mindset of switching. RP is also considered a back-up poly for poly dropouts."
GloxyVI,1,"As someone who went to Biz, Law, FASS and Eng for mods, it depends on the standard deviation of talent.

The C- to B- range for each of the school's mod were very different. Law would be tougher because most law students are AAA/A people. The rest is by luck and usually not an issue.

But no matter what course you pick, the B+ to A+ range is usually more or less the same in terms of intensity of competition. That range usually the people are \*not\* stupid/lazy. You will know this because it will be the same few people popping up time and time again fighting you for that A. It will get to the point where the moment you open up the module name list, you see that guy's name and go:

""HIM AGAIN?! There goes my cruise for the semester.""

NUS is bell-curved so there is no such thing as ""History is easier than let's say Biz"". It may be easier at the middle to lower ranges, but at the higher ranges the intensity is more or less the same. There are only 25% A- to A+ given out no matter where you look.

Another thing is your college essentials/common mods, that stop students from ""hiding"" in their respective courses. If your course truly had easy competition compared to the rest, then your common mods with everyone else or your UEs will kill your CAP.

No easy FCH wherever you go. But if you wanna pass/cruise with 2nd lower or 3rd, then pick the lowest IGP course and enter holiday mood."
Koufas,1,">But let’s say you’re a blank piece of paper, no interests and no particular strength, which degree/course at which Uni do you think has the lightest workload?

I do think that this is pretty unrealistic. Everyone is different 

>If such scenario cannot be held then what course/degree at least in your own personal experience do you think has the lightest workload?

I would ask the person asking me this to spend more time on identifying their strengths/weaknesses/interests before choosing a course of study, and if they don't know how to do this, to reach out to friends, past teachers, parents, online, google, anywhere, to help them do that in a serious conversation. Someone who knows them. Some secondary schools/JCs/Poly have a career department as well you can consider

Could also consider learning more about what is out there and see what this person is drawn too

I feel like most students don't do this enough because we are focussed on exams all the time until the point we forget that exams are just a means to an end, rather an end in of itself

Spending more time working on ourselves and figuring out who you are before making tough decisions is, in the long run, the lightest workload. Because if we don't, we end up in a situation we find ourselves not being too happy, and it would be much more of a grind to push ourselves through everyday"

You have every right to take the exams and they have to treat you like any other student as per SOP. If they make your life difficult straightaway report to MOE, but tbh I'm p sure they got better things to do than make your life difficult. We all make mistakes in the past and the fact that you are retaking to improve your score and give yourself a better footing in the future is v admirable compared to a person who just gives up after bad results.

The next step, once you ORD'ed, whether the momentum is there to continue is entirely up to you. Side gigs are well......encouraged, but then again, its up to you.

Learn from me, i completed NITEC (2006-2008), went to Poly, can't handle the heat, got out of it, work 6 months part time, went to NS and ORD'ed, (2008 - 2015). Been working for 7 years full time oil and gas industry (2016 till today)

(0 prior experience) but yeah i got rejected from those that i applied for.. i couldve applied for private uni but i didnt cos of school fees, thought that if i take a gap year instead to work, at least i can help reduce the sch fees burden. ok ngl gap year was like my last resort also but tbh it was a blessing in disguise for me HAHA i worked at a part time job, talked to some older people and they gave me many gd advices, and during this long break u rlly can explore all u want and have all the time to think about what u are truly interested in and want to pursue in the future.
just rmbr that u dont have to rush ur education, take a break to think thru thoroughly first. some careers require more skills than an academic cert! i mean rn u can try to apply for whatever comes to mind, if fail then a gap year is really not too bad of a decision, can try to apply for uni again the following year too (w more money & clarity in life)!!

ExcitingYoghurt1553,20,"listen man, the grades that you have achieved are not the most important thing in the world, and mind me those are some very impressive grades especially for arts subjects. i know this is overused but it has been revealed to me that grades simply allow u to evolve in a single aspect of your life, your career. and in my eyes (and arguably anyone reading your post), you have done more than enough to evolve to the next stage of your career. do not let this be a moment for you to feel lost, you have made this effort and u fucking did this, YOU! not your parents or your friends. dont let anything in this world discredit your achievements no matter how good they are compared to others. take time to reflect and find answers in terms of what you’d prefer to do in uni and for work and arrive at a suitable decision, your dads friends daughter wont be laughing in your face or anything if u go to a course with a lower cut off point or something. do you. and this habit of self harm is something u may have impulsively developed and it has turned into a traumatic cycle for u. you are of a good age now, and you’ll have people relying and depending on u in some years. dont hurt yourself, chisel yourself into a person who can truly move forward and essentially bear the outcomes of what is to come. hurting yourself never has, and never will help u in any of this but rather allow u to plummet down. jc is done and over and u got a sick score for A levels, move on and find your purpose and never look back. 
i apologise if this was a little blunt but i genuinely empathised with you reading this post and really wanted to help you out, ive had my own share of family problems and similar effects so it hit a little close. i hope this has had some good effect on you and that u consider what ive said. from the bottom of my heart, i wish u a very eventful and joyful journey in life. all the best dude."
Business-Attorney-45,3,"Hi OP, your score rlly allows u to have many options, I believe there will be one that you like. pls don't be ashamed of yourself just because ur parents or anyone compare u with someone else who scored better. u did your best and it's a rlly significant improvement from your usual grades (I am impressed by ur improvement honestly). ik a lot of parents like to compare but I dislike it, just gonna tell u a true story: when I was in pri sch, my results were pretty much decent (I feel) like constantly in the top 25%. then the mother of my super close friend will alw compare me with her (sometimes in front of me) even though my mum doesn't boast abt me. I can see how disappointed she was and I empathised with her. She's doing well now, studying sth she likes with her friends. 

So the point is that A level isn't the end, ur parents' comparison isn't the end and someone else doing better than u is also not the end. pls believe in yourself and don't think too much abt how others think of you. At the end of the day, you are yourself, you can't change how others think BUT you can change how u think. I rlly hope you can find something that interests u and motivates you. pls pls pls be more confident in yourself okay? u deserve those good results! I believe u will be doing better and better in the future, don't be ashamed of urself."
LifeGoesOnStillX,2,"If you are affected by the people around you, then look at others who did worse than you as well. Many will want to swap your achievement with theirs. And find someone else who really care about you, love you. This takes time, in the meantime find something to occupy your time. Explore other interests. Most of the times, life is hard. Your parents seem to have ignore your feelings, did not give recognition you deserved or they don't know how to handle your feelings, not sensitive enough. I had the same problem too but I managed to pull it through. ""Our world"" is not just them. Don't limit yourself to them only. Rather than waiting for someone to love me, I chose to be the one to give love to everyone else and expect no return. One fine day, you will meet the right one."

sjjdnsnsns,55,"hello! jc3 student that took 4H2s BCME :-) For all subs, i did tys from 2017-2021, and throughly went through them. I aimed to do one full year per subject per week for BCM. For econs and GP i consistently wrote essay plans (i mean like 3-5 essay plans A DAY). did this from october onwards till the actual papers. My A level rp was 88.75, all As and B for chem

bio and chem: spammed papers and memorised answers. lol ill be so fr but the chances of A levels being a repeat of questions uve seen before is super damn high. I made sure to do every single practical paper i could find (so familiarise myself with potential planning questions) and memorised the answer sheet to the different questions. For written papers, i did flashcards on questions and made sure i knew my chunks to commonly asked questions (like for chem, ionic and covalent structure explanations, transition element colour explanation etc. As you do more papers u will find that there are chunks u must know, i made sure to convert those to memory). I collated hard questions for both subjects and also went through them every day. My grades jumped from D in bio to A, and E in chem to B. 

Econs: spammed a shit ton of essay outlines, did almost every essay question i could get my hands on. Soon u will find a pattern to answering the questions, and when u can spot the pattern its pretty much a memory test. I also did mindmap for each topic (micro, macro, market failure etc). I made sure to know EVERY possible graph (just go through papers and look at the possible graphs they draw), and i made sure to know every single chunk. If udk anything, srsly just arrange consult. Econs is seriously about how hard you are willing to grind, and hard work does pay off. i jumped from D to A for As

GP: similar theory, mindmap and essay outlines. Arrange a shit ton of consults and get teachers to go through. No consult nvrm discuss with friends. Make sure you have topics you are confident in (for me was Environment, politics, arts, media), and that you know all the common arguments to these topics (read as many model essays as you can find and take note of them). I also did alot of research and reading in my own free time by following inforgraphic instagrams and noting down interesting examples and points. For compre srsly must practice and understand the trick to different question types (i collated all into a google doc for easy ref). I jumped from a C to A

math: ok tbh my math have always been good. but the trick is to get rlly good through practice. for pure math its rlly practice so that youre fast and dont crack under pressure. for stats there are things u can memorise so i made sure to get that down. I also collated tricky or hard questions and would constantly redo and review them. I went from a B to A

TLDR, for revision, just rlly be consistent and practice ALOT. redo tutorials, rewrite essay plans, commit to finishing papers. making notes is only 30%, rlly doing the papers and understanding the rhythm to answering is the key to scoring well in any subject. For TYS, i didnt focus on quantity but really quality, making sure i understood every single mistake i made (i only did tys from 2016 to 2021 for my subjects.) Grinding papers and collating all my mistakes into one document worked wonders for me;;  i did this in every single subject and saw such a significant improvement. If it helps, i draw mindmaps and make aloot of diagrams to study for certain subjects. i also use flashcards to memorise. i had a collation of commonly asked question for all my subs and would revise them thoroughly before every A level paper

most importantly would be consistency. I studied pretty consistently throughout jc2 and even jc1, so i didnt have much backload of work or lectures to catch up on. i understand the issue of commitments; i had 3-5 training days a week up till april. But i managed to squeeze in time each day to revise (before and after training, and i dedicate the whole of sunday to finish work and watch lectures). imo, its rlly impt that u dont lag behind significantly; once you start it really really snowballs, and ive seen so many friends still catching up on that content during the few months before As. If you set your priorities straight (i deleted tiktok and limited usage on insta), it is possible to catch up. 

Also make sure u have a good sleep schedule so youre energised and ready to tackle a days worth of revision! A levels is a marathon, dont over rely on caffeine to push through each day. Eventually the fatigue will wear you out so just make sure you have enough sleep from the start. Dont be discouraged by your test or exam results (if it gives you comfort, my grades were on a steady decline from the first jc2 test all the way to prelims), take each mistake in stride and work harder for the next test. All the best!"
ImpressiveOven5829,38,"Hi Alvl 2022 batch ex student from top tier JC here. J1 to 1st half J2 was really slack for me. Barely did homework,gaming/sleeping during lessons.Scored 38rp for mid terms in J2. Next 2months to prelims studied on average 10hours a day finishing all undone tutorials and revision packages. Prelims scored 87rp. In the run up to A lvls slowed the intensity and focused on testpapers and timed practices (other schools prelim and TYS). First few testpapers i did it open book to recap concepts. Last few testpapers more of time management and simulating exam conditions. Actual A-lvls 90rp with h3 physics distinction. PCME but C for computing combi.

u rlly just need to practice speaking loudly, in ur own time and during practice, bcus projection of voice is the bare minimum. a lot of the time the issue will be gesturing, pacing, enunciation, tone, etc. so get the bare min. down first or you wont be able to do anything.

Plane_Ice712,13,"Always - I mean always - pre-read your notes. Highlight what may be keywords, concepts, things you ought to know by heart or memorise (e.g. formulas, key ideas etc.). If you can understand what the notes say during your pre-read, great. Now you have a sense of what's going to be taught. Then proceed on to attend the lectures and pay close attention, especially the parts you dont understand initially. Active listening, active note-taking. Write down what the lecturer says that is not in the notes but is otherwise critical for you to know or help you absorb the content.

After the lecture, re-read the notes a third time. Clarify your doubts with your peers and your teachers. If your JC records the lecture, rewatch the lectures to understand key parts you may have missed.

Finally, for every chapter (or in the bigger chapters, subtopics), make mindmaps/lists of key formulas, ideas etc. Make sure you know when to apply them (very important!), how to apply them (any terms or conditions before you apply?), and what to include (if the formula is F = mv²/r, don't leave it as F = v²/r because v²/r is for acceleration!).

Money_Ad_9800,2,"Hi there. Was previously a grad from poly. Sharing what I know. (I was from RP, but nonetheless the processes are roughly the same)

1. PSEA is the post secondary education account that every (Singaporean) student will have after secondary school, which youre eligible. You can check your PSEA balance through more details here. https://www.moe.gov.sg/financial-matters/psea/overview

2. If your PSEA has enough funds to cover your fees, then u can use it to pay for the poly fees. From my experience, your PSEA will be deducted fully by your sch fees after 1 to 2 yrs. So thereafter; you can either use GIRO to pay - if u have enough money. Alternatively, if you do not wish to use GIRO to pay, u can use either your parents CPF account or bank loan. 

Hope this clarifies. Do let me know if u have further qns. U can PM me too!"

There are tons of successful ppl out there who are introverts like elon muskk. Naaa u will be the resilient kids who dont give up jst bcs you failed. No one will look down at you, or if they do, ignore it. Embarrassment is the way to succeed. No one likes someone who jst looses hope not someone whose an introvert. So show them that you are hard at core.  And they will respect you or like you with someone who still continues studying despite failing. Its not who reaches the endline first mannn.

Responsible_Hat_2912,9,"personally i feel that astro you cant build up your portfolio that much (besides attaining leadership position/one or two comps afaik) but please correct me if not! ren and astronomy are a decent combi and will not be the heaviest workload, but as a dual-cca member it was truly difficult to juggle. if you do not feel comfortable with the workload you should drop a cca later, but it is true that it gets much more stressful later on, and those who take two ccas also struggle to a large extent, especially if you have a leadership role. it is easy to get complacent with the workload at the beginning of y5, but if you forsee that you will face issues (from your current experience), just choose one cca. two ccas but bad grades will not be as helpful as 1 cca and good grades. besides ccas you can do CE01s as well and other external projects, so there's always ad hoc opportunities if you want to build your portfolio as well."

chloekwy,2,"hello, y1 fass student doing cs as a minor not 2nd major, but i can answer some of your questions! as far as i know there are no direct entry fass + cs double majors (closest is econs + bza), so you can't apply for cs 2nd major at the point of admission.

cs is a restricted minor/ 2nd major, so you have to apply for it through edurec (online portal) within a limited window near the end of every sem, and you would only get your application result after that sem's exam results are released. 

i doubt they look at rp but for 2nd major, a B+ and above is required for both cs1010 and cs2040 (or their variants). i'm not sure if you have to take both mods before applying for the 2nd major though. you can refer to their website https://www.comp.nus.edu.sg/programmes/ug/majorc/cs-secmajor/

do note that even if you meet the basic requirements, you might not be able to get the 2nd major bc it's so competitive now; also a 2nd major is likely more difficult to get than a minor.

as for workload, i'm only planning to take 1 cs module per sem so i can't really comment, but cs mods are notoriously time-consuming and i can attest to this :"") be prepared to spend double or more of your time on cs as compared to your other mods"
throwaway23453435,16,"As a non-Singaporean who studied in SG all the way to JC, I can give you some insight. Although I don’t know much about the specific courses you are interested in, I think it’s important to be aware of just how competitive SG uni applications are for foreigners. The IGP of various courses can’t be used by foreigners as a rough gauge as you will most likely have to score much higher than the cut off to qualify for uni courses. I’ve had foreigner friends scoring 70+RP who did not qualify for ANY course in the big 3 at all. Even foreigners with decent A level results have to settle for less competitive courses, and didn’t get their top choice of course despite meeting the IGP cut off. Scholarships will also be nearly impossible to secure as a non-citizen and without stellar academic achievements/portfolio.

Besides considering overseas uni options, if you’re concerned about costs of tuition, have you thought about uni options in your country of citizenship? Most countries offer uni loans to their citizens and it might be easier to secure such uni loans/bursaries."
bananaramasamagama,2,"hi i was in a similar spot as urs a year back. context: im foreigner, 78.75rp

qn1: i was accepted in SMU IS with interview, u can try applying to SWE too, the cut off point might be lower

qn2: do look out for overseas options, however, keep in mind that overseas universities in some countries might be significantly more expensive than singapore (eg Australia, US and UK). afterwards, see which courses u got accepted in SG and overseas, and make an informed decision. u might want to meet up with your school's career counselor too.

qn3: you can look into universities in europe, their tution fees might be cheaper than singapores (eg Netherlands, Finland etc), and if ur looking into Germany, it might just be completely free. in fact, i am studying in germany now, and i have to pay only €600 a year for uni fees. but do keep in mind that the places in german uni for international students is extremely scarce, and u might have to learn some german too if u want to survive."
VelvetGlider,4,"1. Forget good chance, as a foreigner I don’t think you even have a chance."
Accomplished-Help880,1,"BA student here.

usually in your first year there is a coding module that can only be downloaded on windows (c# programming), hence that’s why they encourage windows and also for modules that have photoshop, the tutor will be teaching keyboard short cuts (which only apply to windows). 

i started out with a (dell) windows laptop in my first two years and it gave up on me so i bought a macbook when i was year 3. i’d suggest just buy the macbook, make sure there’s enough space (idk is it called RAM or something) to install windows onto your mac so you can get through your first year. 

in 2021 when i consulted it help desk, this is what they told me:

“Please note that for your course a Windows notebook is recommended and therefore you will need to install Virtual Box in your MacBook to use Windows OS software.

You will need to ensure your MacBook meets the minimum specifications for Virtual Box installation, Must be Intel Processor, 8GM RAM either 256GB or 512GB hard disk with at least 100GB available storage.

Is your MacBook M1 chip or Intel chip?

Do provide us with the screenshot of your MacBook’s specification for verification.”

You should just check with the helpdesk queen dora

Dora.ITCare@connect.np.edu.sg

I really regretted purchasing the Dell laptop, it was $1.6k and really really heavy whereas now in my Y3 i’m using macbook air, also around $1.6k after education discount iirc

But if you’re gonna use macbook from Y1, suggest you buy macbook pro so it can handle coding and photoshop else your laptop’s gonna crash"

2) & 3) It is dependent on your course as well, maybe you can look on your school's website to know what you'll learn in the next 3 years. But usually laptop and charger are a must, and notebook not so much if the module is more of coding or presentation.

4) Honestly poly is quite chill about things. You can even dye your hair or skip classes. But RP is known to be the stricter one among all the polys so you can ask your seniors what are some don'ts during orientation.

5) I'm from NP but lives near RP. I can tell you NP is much more confusing haha. RP should be easy to navigate around.

6) I think the basic things you should already know, like just try your best and find common interests, ect. If nothing works, try to strike convos with your group mates as well. Or you can join CCAs to find like-minded people.

4) honestly most faci's don't care 

5) there are maps pasted on pillars basically everywhere , quite hard to get lost

6) You will probably be assigned a table with some other students, so just try and start some convos with them

I’m am certain that they are mature enough to understand that you had your personal reasons and will respect it. In my opinion, I think you should evaluate what are the pros and cons of telling them vs not telling them. What I could think of now is that if you tell them, they will treat you will more care, empathy and compassion. They may also try their absolute best to make you feel happy and leave with memorable memories. I think the only “ con “ would be you might feel that they are only treating you in such a way because of your terminal illness. I hope you don’t see it that way. But if you do, you need to put yourself in their shoes, I.e they want to cheer you up ! They care and love you ! It’s good to have a positive attitude and perspective in life. But I’m sure you’re already have that. On the other hand, not telling them may lead to regrets, as you won’t be able to say your final proper goodbyes! They are likely to also be more disheartened to see you go without them noticing and they might even put the blame on themselves for not noticing your true feelings and what you have been going through! However, this is ultimately your choice. I sincerely hope that you’ll stay strong and positive as you’re already are.

Tzuyuuuuuuuuuuuuu,6,"I can’t say shit, just good luck.  

At this point if you really feel demotivated, all I can say is find things to do. It’s fine if it’s temporary, just do something. 

I don’t have a exact experience, but I was damn depressed for a period of time over about a year…not depression, but just really affecting me and made me very demotivated. Well I didn’t do shit that year, I still don’t know how I got passed it. I hardly remember shit that happened… so…. 

Well the only advice I can give regarding what you are feeling, is just do things. Anything. If you want to, I think learning different things may be good. You’ll leave more things about you behind such that your parents will remember. Don’t mind me being depressing, or just truthful. I think you’ve thought about it too. 

Since you can’t change anything , it’s either you yourself find ways to overcome your feeling, or that you let people around you feel less shit. 

Regarding your friends and partner… it really depends on you I guess. But I think you should at least let your partner know…or maybe give your partner some sort of heads up in advance. With your friends, either tell your parents or a common friend to contact them in the worst scenario if you don’t feel like telling them yourself."

swjs00,5,"1. Prestige may or may not matter depending on how you define prestige. I see two possible way to define prestige. First, it is the rankings. Those rankings dont mean anything as an undergraduate as it only measures how recognized the research at that university is. Secondly, it's the reputation of the university (e.g. by word of mouth). Then you might want to figure out how good the university is at what you value most (e.g. does the uni offer you the mods you want to take? does the uni have a reputation for lousy professors and half-baked modules?). Talk to your potential seniors to find out more. 
2. Imo, both are valid strategies. It is possible to start of in NUS IS/CEG and then try to pivot over to CS. Others have tried that, but it is not always guaranteed to be successful. I would advise that you find out what the differences between these degree paths are and then figure out which you would be most comfortable with in the event you do not manage to convert over to CS. You should NOT accept a course simply with the hope to convert to CS later on, because you wont like it if it does not work out. So, what is your passion? Are you just in tech for the money? Or do you have a personal interest in a particular area of tech (e.g. the digital electronics? the microarchitecture? the algorithms? cybersecurity? business applications?) Alternatively, you can go to SMU CS or NTU CS as well. They offer a similar curriculum. You could even try to transfer to NUS CS from there (although it is not a guarantee that itll work). If you just want a CS degree, NTU and SMU works fine too. But I would advise you talk to seniors from each of the different unis to discuss what the different shortcomings and strengths of the CS curriculum are in the different unis. The name of the degree may be the same, but the way the curriculum is taught will vary."

ineedurgenthelp-05,11,"lived here all my life, jc now and its virtually impossible. you can get into a more prestigious uni in india for med. and rmb u are competeing w many many foreigners who all want that ONE spot. build up ur portfolio, but do also aim for those top med colleges in india."
RandomDude_-,11,"I'm extremely sorry to say this but even with outstanding performance in india studies it's highly likely that you'll only be able to enter a normal institution in sg. I've seen some that come from india worh spectacular results but get posted to a lower tier JC even that after struggling. 

I think studying in some other country then coming to singapore to work as a doctor might be a plausible idea. 

Medicine is super competitive in singapore and even for singapore A levels(very difficult), you need to have outstanding results(mostly As) and 85rp(very high score max is 90. You may not understand this but it's on google if you want to know more). Even for Singaporeans medicine is very hard to get into and iinr uni here for medicine is 7 years and seats are limited.(especially for non citizens. I think only 2 PRs and 1 foreigner have vacancy for medicine)

If your results are excellent as you've mentioned then I don't think you should have that much of a problem getting into a decent university anywhere in the world. 

All the best!!!"
Advanced_Sea7519,7,Most likely need all India rank of < 1000 to have a realistic chance

8BOTTOB8,2,"NEET results will be a factor in your chances. I suggest doing NEET and then if your AIR is already Low, just go for aiims Delhi or smth, if it’s not enough to go there or surrounding universities, you might need strong portfolio like medical internships, courses in depth in medicine, etc. to be considered here. 

My best advice is go for AIIMS first. Then come here."

Koufas,14,"CS and IS are two pretty different programmes imo

To me the key question is do you want to take CS or IS, and if you want to go to SMU or NUS. SMU also has CS, although it is a lot newer than NUS. SMU also has overseas exchange programmes

Regardless of which school you go to, or which course you take, there will always be opportunities overseas if you are good enough. There is also not much of a difference in prestige between NUS and SMU overseas - especially if you're not applying for academia

I will say that if you don't really like math youll have a pretty rough time especially in CS lol"

KnowledgeDry7060,2,"All that info should be on [https://studentnet.nafa.edu.sg](https://studentnet.nafa.edu.sg) you will need your admission number and password to access the student handbook.

boosheeet88,22,"I guess it's part of life as different people have their different paths so yall may not always be together. How about looking at the wait from a different perspective? e.g great time for you to try new hobbies/things on your own before poly starts which may get super busy that you miss the free time. I was also went poly and like you, after Os I worked part-time job which I didn't like ahaha (i skipped it oops). If you miss your friends you can always arrange outings once in a while but do understand that its okay to not be together all the time. If they are good friends, seeing each other once-a-year is as impactful as the nostalgic times yall spent in secondary school. Good friends do not need to meet everyday. Another advice is: Please don't choose routes based on your friends as it's your own journey, do whatever suits you best instead. Also, after you grad from poly the wait will be infinite as theres no more ""direct path"" since with a Diploma, you can choose either to go uni or work (and army for the boys). The waiting game is in many stages of life so needa get used to it heh"

GloxyVI,1,"I can only comment on DA/DS stuff.

For DA, one of the major weaknesses is domain knowledge in the field you are trying to be a DA/DS at.

A DS/DA without knowledge in medical terms trying to work in the medical field will run into headaches trying to derive anything insightful. The same goes for engineering. Think I mentioned it here before, but my bosses do not like pure DA/DS people because of this where they brought on more problems to the Eng org than they did benefits.

Every single feature, they had to keep bugging staff on what it means and when they derived 'insights' it was quite obvious to management. 

If you do pick DA/DS, do have a domain in mind that you wanna do. Be it Maritime, Hotels, Real Estate etc and drill down before you graduate. This understanding hasn't been caught on by the rest of employers but at least from where I am looking it's starting to become apparent. 

It's easier to train Eng people into DS than it is DS into Eng. Depends on the scope/scale of the domain knowledge needed."

biskwy,16,"I want to preface my comment that clearly your intentions are good, but it isn't enough. You recognize there is a flaw in Singapore's conservative system and attempt to change it. 

The problem is you're not working along with the system and trying to effect change. You're working against the system, blaming the system rather than reflecting what is the most optimal solution you can effect change.

For e.g., when it comes to 40 slides about mental health, it may feel hurtful for so much content to be cut down. But nobody enjoys sitting through 40 slides of content that they don't personally care about. It's teaching you to captivate the audience's attention. In this case, less is more. 

Of course lecturers mark according to the paper, the rubrics are there. But I highly doubt when the situation arises and you're presented an opportunity to input mental health topics, you'll be penalised for that. 

The rest of your post is valid. But until you introspectively reflect on what you could've done better in an academic setting, fighting the conservative system head on as a lone ranger is simply not enough."
Alienmonsterkid,6,Can discuss wih fellow ite schoolmates in [chats](https://linktr.ee/ITEgroupchats)
CaptainBroady,19,"It goes back to politics actually. After all, Singapore is pretty much a conservative society (despite how progressive young people are these days) 

But yes i think if there's more conversations about sexual and mental health (effective ones, rather than paper exercises), it'll benefit students much more"
Sarcastic-Student616,5,"hey, OP! sorry to hear about your mental health struggles. as someone diagnosed with depression and a dissociative disorder and is trying very, very hard to find joy and meaning in even being alive, mental health advocacy is something deeply personal to me. my school does have a ‘mental health week’ which (to me anyway) is more of a formality than anything; i don’t really find it helpful, but hey, at least it’s there.

i think the issue is, like what others have said, singapore’s conservativity. taboo topics like mental health and lgbtq+ are often topics you see schools avoiding or minimising discussion about, to the detriment of students that relate to them. coupled with the shame and perceived ‘weakness’ surrounding mental health and you get a somewhat lukewarm response. despite this, i like to think that things are changing for the better. i’ve been met with more empathy than ever from my friends when i’ve dared to open up about my mental health struggles - of course, there’s still work to be done, but i believe we can make this change happen with enough genuine passion and kindness.

thanks for sharing your thoughts! wishing you the best for the future <3"

rudolphrednose25,45,"Idk man, I'm only silver rank"
LaZZyBird,109,"Honestly in CS unless you really, really have a passion for the subject, FCH is impossible. 

There are some students that are start-up founders at 18, won international hackathons, top 0.01% HackerRank, top contributors to npm etc. These people will smoke you at CS1010 and other basic computing courses. It is like putting you in a class with primary school students and giving you a math test, except you are the primary student. You will study hard and get a B/B+ while they are busy doing whatever they are doing, miss all the lectures and tutorials, come for the test and ace it, get A/A+, because the things you are doing are so basic to them. 

However, CS is such a huge field there is no need to always compete with them to get a decent job and/or do the things you want. Coding has been, in my opinion, getting easier and easier over the years. For example, if you want to code a website from scratch, you can use Flask to write basic backend for your website, use python packages to handle security and authentication, use a simple DB like Postgres or some NoSQL database for your data, use Tailwind CSS or Vue (or like ten other front-ends) to handle UI and be done with it in a week. You don't need to actually ""code"" any of the core logic in the whole process, all you are doing is piecing together different already pre-written API's into a Frankenstein website that works. 

Same for data science. Scikit, PyTorch, NumPy etc. all have pre-written functions that you can use to do the things you want to do most of the time, and getting good data is arguably harder than processing it. 

CS, in some weird way, is like learning a life skill. You never ""lose"" passion for it, it just becomes part of you and the way you view the world. Oh, I want to automate something in this game I am playing, let see if there is a Lua script for it. Oh, I want to reply to comments on Reddit automatically, lets try to write a bot using the Reddit API. Oh, I wonder how many tweets are about X, lets see if I can use BeautifulSoup to get it."
swjs00,17,"If CS is your passion, just apply for that program in all the schools (NUS, NTU, SMU, SUTD). Don’t worry so much about whether u can make it. Let the school(s) decide. It will be very competitive, and there are people who lose passion for it and regret joining CS. But there are those people who also joined it without having written a single line of code and they are now very competent computer scientists. And there are those who regret not joining CS (like me)"
Key_Pie_135,34,if you're talking about nus cs I know a friend who got rejected last year when he got 87.5 so yea it's really competitive and I don't think it's coming down anytime soon. With that said you most likely could do cs in ntu and smu with your score!
Apprehensive_Plate60,25,"pls unds while ges pay high, doesnt apply to all grads. CS degree does not automatically means high pay. Still need to hv aptitude and hardwork. Cs get degrees. You dont hv to be expert to pass exams, but you are alrdy behind those that can score well and unds what they are doing.

you apply for high pay jobs, many similiar candidates are also applying. There is competition, esp for the higher paying jobs. If you cant pass or do well in technical tests or interviews, you wont be able to get that high pay you hoped for. End up disappointed.

Those who didnt get as high of a salary prob didnt do the ges anw. So take it w a grain of salt

Good that you hv passion, but hope that you wont get dejected. Seeing ppl do assignments w ease, getting As while skipping lec and tutorials, leaving exam halls early and score easy A, multiple internships during sch term and holidays..... Some ppl are really beasts. Dont forget the international students. Those are the ones that get the so called high pay jobs. The gap will be shown through technical tests and interviews."
