lulmaomao,5,"Are you referring to SIT UofG CS? If so then you're looking at 3 years at SIT vs 3-4 years at SMU. Opportunities-wise I feel that SMU will have better opportunities handed to you, along with more CCAs and interest groups. But this isn't something that you will never get at SIT, there are still opportunities here and the differences isn't something hard work cant make up for.

For internship opportunities, it'll be more or less the same across all the unis. Everyone still has to go through the usual interview process for top-tier tech internships, I don't think university matters in this aspect.

It's also good to note that theres the WSDeg programme for SIT UofG CS which enables you to get 12 months of intern exp before grad, but not for SMU IS / CS.

Why not consider SMU's  Software Engineering with WSDeg? Seems like a good middle-ground between IS and CS, and it even guarantees internship placement as well. It's good to take into account the 1 year diff between SIT and SMU too"

abystandingduck,1,"Well well, looks like I found a twin of mine hahahahah. I am in the exact position as you. I didn't do well enough for SMU CS but well enough for IS. Have the option to go SIT CS but second guessing myself because of the big 3 branding. 

I've decided that I will go for SIT CS. My reasons are

1. I came from Business & IT course in poly (similar to IS) and am currently in a coding unit in NS. What I realised when comparing myself to my peers who have full IT background ( not half half like me) is that they are alot better than me yet they are only scratching the iceberg of CS. Therefore, I feel that you have to specialising in CS if you want to be a dev next time 

2. Studying for CS is impt but to me, experience is alot more useful as we will forever be learning in this sector. Therefore I will just clear uni in 3 years and go out to learn the most relevant knowledge.

3. SIT focus on applied learning is also appealing to me because I like learning with examples and projects instead of theory and textbook. 

And lastly, SMU sch fees very ex lol

Ok hope this helps you to decide :)"

SpicyBananaNoodle,5,"I wore formal - blouse, pencil skirt and ballerina flats. But from what I observed when I went for my interview, some people wear formal (with tie and blazer) and some wear more casual (polo shirt and jeans). I think it is best to at least wear a button-up shirt. Because it won't reflect well if the interviewers were to compare a casual attire to another applicant's formal attire, especially since it is a group interview. 

Btw good luck for your interview!"
Living_Albatross_895,5,"Not sure if this is a permanent thing or a Covid thing. Anw, I’m from ‘22 intake. So I had my interview last year. It was conducted online (not live). You play a few videos with a question each and you get 1-2 mins to record your answer with video. For this, I did not wear formal, coz I was at home. Literally in just NS admin attire hAHAHAHA. But I got my placement after the first round. So good i guess? Not sure how they go through so many applicants' vids tho. 

If you fail the first round, then u will get the chance for a second interview. My friend wen through round 2, he said that its face-to-face interview. So if you do get there, maybe it might be a better idea to dress up a bit. It was conducted over Zoom though. 

All the best for your interview."
Seloving,2,"I wore a polo T and jeans but most around me donned formal wear with a tie. I got in anyway.

As someone said, it's better to be overdressed but as long as you look presentable and neat I don't think they will actually take your attire into account unless you show up completely disheveled with unkempt hair, stained clothes, and slippers."

Living_Albatross_895,2,"Not from Fintech, but another ICT course in SIT. One of my mods the prof is the programme lead for Fintech. He is really nice guy. Chatted with him about his course, sounds not too bad. One of the reasons why they open these new courses that he mentioned was coz the Govt wants more grads in these spaces. From what I rmb, Fintech will be having more IWSP time. if I not wrong, every year got 1, so instead of doing 1 final IWSP at the end of Year 3, you will do one each year. So study 2 trimesters, work 1 trimester."

Your diploma may not necessarily be an advantage during interview, be prepared for them to ask why you want to jump ship.

birdnestfern,4,"Hi there! I'm still a student but I think I can try to help you with some of your queries!

1) Working life

Being a physio allows you to work in a variety of settings, from acute settings all the way to ILTC (intermediate to long term care) settings, and you can work in private clinics too. Working hours would differ from which setting you work in, some settings might see you working on PHs and weekend shifts. However, this also means that you can get to see a huge range of patients, ranging from the very young to the geriatrics, and they might come with a myriad of conditions for you to see and treat.

&#x200B;

2) Career progression

From my understanding, after you get some years of clinical experience under your belt, you can essentially branch out into Clinical, Research and Management.   


More info can be found here! https://www.caretogobeyond.sg/ahp/highlights/care-gallery/webisodes/physiotherapist 

Or if you can, talk to one! 

&#x200B;

Hope this helps, and atb in your application! :)"
birdnestfern,1,Depends on what you eventually want I guess! I know of a rare few who went on to study medicine (both locally and oveeseas) after working for a couple of years.
NovelInspection7375,10,"Hi! Alumni here with some years experience. First and most importantly is to email your  nearest hospital - Careers/Radiology Dept and ask for a JOB SHADOW. Go and experience half a day and talk to every radiographer you see. Hear their thoughts and question them extensively. 

*Career*

Different hospitals have different career progression timelines. Everyone starts of doing General Xray which is your basic chest xray, limbs, abdomen, spine etc. USUALLY this phase will take 2- 4 years before you move into a modality. General xray include Outpatient (those random ppl for checkups), Emergency Dept (car accidents, drunken fights, falls), Inpatient (bedbound, infection diseases, end-of-life patients, ICU, abuse cases), some hospitals also include Flouroscopy and Bone Mineral Density scans as general xray.

Modalities include CT, MRI, Angio, Ultrasound etc. Because each modality requires training - some up to months; IF there are multiple people ahead of you in the queue for a hotly contested modality - the wait can be longer.  People have been known to switch hospitals because they were promised a slot in their desired modality, thereby increasing the waiting time for those already working there.

Once you have done you modailty training and are part of the modailty team, the hospital will schedule you to either work in your modality or in general xray. It is uncommon but not unheard of to do multiple modailties. From here, you either get more responsiblity in terms of leadership roles within your modality or in general xray (Clinical). You could do Education which is to split your time with SIT and your hospital or go the Management route which will require other training.

*Work Life*

You will need to do shift work if you are in a hospital. These include night shifts where you do 8pm to 8am, afternoon shifts 2pm to 9pm and morning shifts. Altogether about a 42 - 44h work week. Weekends, for most shift patterns, will be compromised. If you are not on shift work, then you get stable hours but no shift pay. Office hours for a general radiographer is more common in private hospitals, but the pay scale and bonus may vary. Usually you will work in a team to run a xray dept but the dept may have a room/role that you are assigned to solo. Eg - Emergency Dept with 2 xray rooms (walk-in), Trauma area (ambulance) and Fever area (infection diseases) will be run by around 4 +/- radiographers. 

Patients may need to change out of clothes, be in handcuffs, crying, violent, in pain, drunk or just outright rude. As the service provider, you will need to handle the patient's pain, the caregiver's worries and the doctors/nurses impatience while procuring optimal radiographs (xray images). 

*Pay*

A few years ago, the base pay in a public hospital as a fresh grad was around 3.8k +/- depending on your grades. If you are called back on an off day or volunteer to work more hours you recive call back pay and allowance pay. Promotion to Senior Radiographer is usually at the 5th year of work or if you are involved in many projects may be slightly earlier. Promotion too results in an increment in pay. 

Overall, being a radiographer is a mentally and physically tough job. You will need to navigate your feeling and emotions in a very negative environment with all the pain and grief around you. It matters alot more if you can communicate well with your patients rather than having the best grades because you need your patients rapport and help to make your job easier. This noble endeavour is not for everyone especially if you dont like being restricted by healthcare processess and dealing with difficult people. However, if you do choose to persue this, we wish you all the best.   


*Work just enough hours, to make just enough money, to do what you love.*"

If it is even remotely possible, there would be some huge drawbacks, like starting from year 1 or something."

memloh,6,">Is there any unexpected delays? rn they said it'll open by 2024.

It will realistically open only when the MRT station that connects the area is open for operations.

From what I see, the Punggol Coast station is still targeted to open in 2024, but worst-case scenario is it can open near the end of 2024.

https://www.lta.gov.sg/content/ltagov/en/upcoming_projects/rail_expansion/north_east_line_extension.html

SIT also stated on their website that they are also expecting the new campus to open in 2024, but I would reiterate the same worst-case scenario as above too.

https://www.singaporetech.edu.sg/about/future-campus/punggol-campus

>Also i'm going in this year, when they open next year will they immediately push everyone into that new campus, or slowly school by school shift there.

FlamingoLow8641,2,Wait for March
Dear-Strawberry-6775,1,when did you apply?
LilBluey,0,applied 30jan not yet
FourTimeFaster,6,"I will answer the life/culture and how SIT ""system"" works. It is very complex unless you are a student in SIT. Once i have explain the ""system"" i will follow answer your question. (For any upcoming prospect freshman this is a guide for you). I will describe as PR as possible and as truthful as possible as i believe people should know about SIT. I am proud to be a student with them

Before you enter SIT. You need to know each degree is different. What i am referring to is the whole degree itself. It can means the duration, cost, credit unit, is it with a overseas uni (OU), SIT culture, facilities, identify, study structure and curriculum. The staff.  


***Degree***

1. Is your degree a full SIT Degree or the degree has a partnership with a OU (overseas university). Example: SIT-Physio and SIT-**Digipen** Mechatronics system, SIT-**NU** (Newcastle University)
2. The duration for SIT degree usually is 4 years and with a OU degree is 3 year (depend on major)
3. All SIT-OU Degree have to go overseas for 3 weeks to 3 months vary from course. (it is extra cost on top of your tuition fees, will cover in the cost section)
4. Cost. Higher credit = more expensive.  SIT-Digipen is 43k and a 3 years degree (with OU) or SIT degree (no OU) is usually 31k. Do read it properly.
5. Going to overseas for a trimester is called OIP (requirement for OU), you are required to go there for a 3 weeks to 3 months (vary from major). There is *""Financial aid""* for you, it is a **LOAN** for you to travel to your OU. (you could not reject as it is a graduating requirement. There are other exemption, if you are unable to travel there)
6. Back to cost, so if you have OU. Your cost is degree + OIP (Travel to OU). For example for Digipen Mechatronics is 43k + 12k. So is 55k for a mechatronics system.

**Curriculum**

1. Currently some major has accreditation by organisation be it local or by their OU Partners. Do go to SIT open house and check with the professor/program leader or check our SIT youtube for more information
2. SIT Is a trimester. So your breaks are extremely valuable. (usually is we use it to rest and recharge or clear more school work). But it also means you graduate in 3 years (currently is 2.8 years for 3 years degree program). 
3. Is a trimester means you cant do a long internship or going to overseas trip with other local uni's because of our curriculum structure 
4. Your OU regulate most of the curriculum. Means the grading for it is different. (not sure does digipen has the high passing requirement. My time there is)
5. There is such thing called **QUIZ.** The quiz is a written quiz, similar to test but is extremely challenging. Think of your whole chapter congest to 1 question, could be simple and hard. Vary from Professor. Example: 4 question 30%. and each 1% is direct equivalent to marks
6. There is **no past year paper per module**
7. It is **EXTREMELY Intense** in SIT vary from major. You really have know what is your goal upon graduating

***Facilities*** 

1. The facilities in SIT is at infant stage. So there are many equipment is bare or lower than the poly equipment. So don't expect to much, they are working their best to improve it.
2. With your student card you are allowed to access all poly facilities (until punggol is build)
3. SIT is doing their best to improve. (i could see from their efforts from the staff)
4. Infant stage to view timetable or website.

***SIT Culture***

1. It has a good school life and student management committee (course representative). BUT! it is **way inferior** to things that was planned in Poly
2. You will have passionate student committee member for cca. Passionate refer to as they are there to fulfil their term as a exco. As i mention, **fulfil** their term as a planning committee. 
3. Staff are doing their best to improve the identity of SIT but the students ........ 
4. Professor and Staffs are the best i have seen in my life. Passionate and willing to help students. But the school culture as a student is questionable.
5. There is no SIT merchandise store. (Regulated) 

***Benefits of being a SIT Student (SITizen)***

1. Flagship IWSP (Internship). 8 Months
2. High internship allowance compare to local university
3. Co-payment Medical Clinics
4. Excellent Staff and Professor
5. Overseas exposure to OU (UK, US depends on OU)
6. Lots of workshop, events to apply for on par with local university
7. Much more, i cant remember (will add on if i have the time)  


To answer your question

1. As for sigma no, it is still a local uni. In fact is one of the full uni (meaning they can open any major they want). The only sigma i have is the student culture in SIT is questionable
2. For discrimination, there is no i have heard from outside but the internal student culture is really questionable.
3. I have mention on the top on SIT Life. If you have question i will gladly reply. The reason why there is no stories because of our Student Culture is really questionable
4. I was not from a elite JC or school. But I would say the staff and professor are really really good. Only the facilities are lacking.
5. SIT Lecturers. Usually refer to Professor (Prof), this vary from major. But for my major the prof are really good at what they are doing and good to work with. But the content that was taught can be questionable both in terms of workload and whatever stuff.
6. As for innovations and ideas, they are open for it. But you need to find the correct channel to express your ideas. The issue is going to the right person with the correct suggestion and your voice to be hear. It usually reach to student level.  I always recommend feedback and offer a suggestion from your POV. So the staff could consider it. But overall staff in SIT are open to listening.
7. Mechantronics Degree is with Digipen. Digipen is the ""harvard of programming"" and is also infamous for their extremely hard curriculum. Every SIT will heard of this course, which the highest \_\_\_\_\_ (i will stop here)
8. Mechantronics Degree most of the alumni graduate to do software engineering. They are one of the highest pay in SIT
9. This vary from course and major, from what I heard from industry expert. They prefer SIT as we are mostly ""Poly Graduate"" which are ready to work with hands on experience and this explain why the internship allowance is higher.
10. For appealing, is depends on what you wanna achieve out of your degree and what you wanna achieve. There is no straight answer for that"
kaleidostar11,3,"Although I didn't attend SIT Mechatronics, I'd like to share my thoughts on the school's programs. In my opinion, the WSDegree, summer internships, and IWSP are all valuable experiences that can significantly boost your employability. From what I've seen, the GES for SIT seems to be quite accurate for my field, with a median salary of $4.95k and a 100% employment rate.

I'm also excited to see how the main campus, set to open in 2024, will enhance the university's identity and student life. Overall, SIT seems like a great choice for anyone looking to pursue a career in their field.

Should be enough until uni.

If too difficult, go freecodecamp instead, which is more easy to digest. TOP is more in depth, but also more diff.

Else, edX app has a free CS50 intro to CS. iirc by harvard or mit idk. CS50.

So either web dev or plain CS, i suggest TOP.

Edit: If you learnt it to a proficient level in poly, you can either go for the github ""build your own X"" page to look for projects to make, or [guide to cs](http://teachyourselfcs.com)

itsatouhouconspiracy,2,"literally just found this subreddit today. 👀 so sflr!

before i answer your qns, i need to preface that digipen (dgp) is primarily a games-oriented school. and dgp will also accept most people without a games background. so, yes we do uiux, but it will pale in comparison to games support. if you're here to do uiux, you're welcome to join! but do note that you will have to step outside of your comfort zone because some modules will require you do work on games. this means doing a bit of coding, art (2d, 3d), music, etc. if you think such experiences may be beneficial to you as a ux designer (despite being outside of your field), you're welcome to consider dgp.

1. likely if your gpa is somewhere around 3.5 you have a good chance of getting in. dgp will be interested in students who want to dabble in interactive experiences, i think.
2. for this, i can't say. i was here for games, so it made sense for me to go to dgp. i think my uiux oriented classmates would say debatable, given the overlap into game dev.
3. it's true. for context, dgp classes are held in the sp campus, which means that you'll be travelling to dover (west side, green line) for classes. sit ccas are open for you to join (we have newsletters connecting us) and people here are pretty friendly/respectful given that everyone has a different workload, but if you say you're a dgp student they'll know you're probably going to be super busy and may not be able to attend gatherings. dgp is notorious for having a packed schedule.  
i wouldn't say it affects me badly, but that's because i'm not really a community-based student. but you definitely lose out on some of the student life experiences ntu/nus students may have.
4. aside from the joint admission process, there's technical differences when it comes to how your classes are handled. currently, uxgd are under digipen only (if im not wrong). whereas imgd/rtis are sit-digipen joint. you'll experience a few differences with uxgd, mostly in relation to your non-ui/non-game dev classes. mostly types of teachers + grading + assignment expectations might be considered a bit differently.   
students who are more involved with sit will understand that their modules have two educators that swap out in-between semesters (2 teachers per mod). grading is a little stricter in these scenarios, i believe? and the joint degree has a few more requirements with regards to graduation (as opposed to purely digipen).   
tl;dr its the technical details, but for uxgd you shouldnt need to worry (i think).

oh-my_101,2,"yo a current student here! Here are my responses to your queries 

1. If I didn’t remember wrongly, they ask me:
 - why did I choose to apply 
 - What’s your greatest strength/ weaknesses 
 - What do you think your team mates will describe you as? 
 Also, if it’s a zoom interview, just remember to remain calm at all time. The prof that interviewed me were very patient and friendly, you don’t have to worry and just answer as though you’re talking to your teacher. 
 (They asked more questions but I don’t remember the rest)

2. Would say that Trimester system is very busy and packed so it’s really important to start your work real early and plan your time well. If you come from a poly route, then I would say Uni is 5 times busier. However, I’ve friends who attends CCAs and some CCAs were more than 1 time a week. It’ll be manageable if you really manage your time.

Crealkiller32,3,"I'm not an SIT student, but I've gone down the engineering accreditation rabbit hole and want to chime in. 

https://www.peb.gov.sg/html/pe_approved.html
PEB recognises programmes accredited by the Engineering Accreditation Board (EAB) of Institute of Engineers, Singapore (IES) under Part IV Division I. PEB recognised degrees qualify holders to test for and become a Professional Engineer in SG. 

https://www.ies.org.sg/Accreditation/EAB10249
IES, through its EAB, is the institution that accredits engineering programmes to be recognised by other Washington Accord (WA) signatories. An SIT programme accredited by EAB is technically equivalent to a US programme accredited by ABET, under the WA. 

As of June 2022, SIT's ""Master of Engineering Technology (Electrical and Electronic Engineering) with Bachelor of Engineering (Electrical Power Engineering)"" has *provisional accreditation* . 

So, through EAB, this particular Master's + Bachelor's combo is ALMOST recognised by PEB and in overseas WA signatory countries. Almost but not quite yet. The process is still ongoing."
thestickbunsen,2,"PART I

Don't worry! I'm not from EPE but my prof is one of the people who are working towards full accreditation for EPE by IES. It currently has the provisional accreditation which means that it's on the way to being fully accredited. Once it IS fully accredited, students who were part of the provisional accreditation phase (who might have graduated) will also be considered fully accredited.

Next, for PE/CEng, it would only matter if you (i) want to work in the UK or (ii) require it for certain certifications (idk if LEWs need accredited degrees, or only work experience, or both?). It is still a recognised degree from a government university. You don't have to worry about whether it's favourable or not — just look at their Industry Advisory Committee. Those are big names in the industry. It'll be crazy for all of them to be advisors to a course where they don't favour the graduates lol

PART II

Not from EPE, and yes I've heard that there's no bell curve, but there is some form of moderation when the grades are too skewed, but afaik it only affects students on borderline grades i.e., A- approaching and A, or D approaching a D+

PART III

Yes I picked SIT and rejected my NTU direct entry to second year

PART IV

gonna let others take the wheel for this teehee"
nervoustanuki,2,"A little late but I'm currently in the course so hope this helps!

1. SIT EPE is currently provisionally accredited and is working towards the full accreditation expected in a year or two. If im not wrong, graduates are eligible for PE registration but there is no recognition overseas under the Washington Accord but don't quote me on this. So what dose this mean at the end of the day? Really nothing much as this is more for licensing and registering of professional engineers overseas. Even then, it can be expected that by the time you graduate the course, the course will be fully accredited.  As for degree recognition, NUS and NTU has name brand recognition as compared to SIT. Are you going to lose out as compared to them? Yes. But will it be alot? IMO, not really unless you do badly. At the end of the day, the degree is ment to help you secure you first/second job. The kinds of internship/projects/people you know play an equally big part in landing you a job. 

2. The curriculum can be quick as there's only 12 teaching weeks and 1 recess week before the exam week. Overall structure of the curriculum consist of 8 trimesters with the 3rd being a lighter load due to the Overseas Immersion Programme. Internship can technically stretch over the last 3 trimesters assuming you are okay to do your capstone project with your internship company. Regarding what you will learn, it is specialised towards the power side for example Physics, we learn thermodynamics skewered towards understanding energy flows in turbines as compared to NTU's more broad based Physics.

3. Honestly, I have a few friends from poly now at NTU and NUS and some really do regret choosing those schools. As their degree is more broad based, they are required to learn a wide range of stuff. If i could choose my school again I probably choose SIT as i feel the curriculum is well paced and there is alot of help and resources offered to you if you need it.

4. My interview was during peak covid so not really relevant anymore haha

If you have any more questions, you can just drop me a PM!"
goldsnek,1,"To answer your last qn on the interviews. For me, in the email/letter that they sent, the school had informed me that the interview would consist of a verbal/regular part  and a technical part. 

So how it went was myself and 2/3 other candidates would be interviewed at the same time. And then your usual interview (aspiration/motivation/why sit/ why this course) questions. 

Then the second part they wrote out some math questions and had us complete them. 

The question I was given was some coordinate question on a graph. iirc, there was a matrix question that one of the other interviewee did

However, you should take my advice with a grain of salt as there are probably many other factors the admissions team take into account."

Holiday-Plan8883,3,"FINALLY A POST ON THIS. I have the same dilemma as u. Have interests in the financial side of things but dk which one to choose. But i jst applied yesterday and my first choice ended up to be fintech. 
Reasons:
 1. Interest in the financial domain. During my software dev internship i got to experience first hand how it is like to work on a product that you have NO interest in whatsoever. It literally bores the shit out of u and i dont gain much from it. THOUGH i did learn a shit ton during my intern which leads me to my second point.
2. This course is a WSD which follows a TITO model. This will allow you to gain work experience becuz after my poly internship as a software developer i realised that literally MOST if not ALL ( if u exclude programming language itself) the things learnt will be on the job and during ur free time.
3. I also went to compared the modules between the 2, compiled them and ask a current computer science senior in SIT what they learnt in those modules. The difference isnt that much from what i see.( u can msg me if wanna know)
4. I am certain of how rigor the course is becuz it is partnered with MAS and have 7 MOU with 6 banks and 1 IT company(OCBC, UOB, etc)
5. Since it is a finance and tech related course. If somehow i get bored of the tech side of things i can always go into the finance side of things becuz i have domain knowledge on it. Which gives me a safe net. Some people get into a job unrelated to their course anyways.
6. I expect fintech to grow in the coming years. From what i see, fintech can be one of the most lucrative careers.

Cons: 
1. Might need to explain to recruiters the diff between ur degree and a computer sci degree. Personally, i would convert to FT after my internship and after your first work experience ur degree shudnt matter that much already.
2. Very new course. Expect growing pains?

Would like to see the others opinion on this as well. THANKS FOR THE POST

EDIT: Grammars becuz i typed this while travelling to school"
lulmaomao,1,"If you want to be a SWE in banks (JPMC/Goldman pays really well), you wont need finance knowledge, just CS.

I’d personally chose CS, and give myself more time on deciding if I want to pursue fintech, and then pivot to that and prep for interviews. Unless you’re dead set on fintech then go for it"
MeijiCat,1,"hello :) i just matriculated into DR last august but if im not wrong, SIT IGP 2022 just came out (shows the % of students and their gpa range).

Its definitely good to have some internship/work experience in hospitals or smth relevant so if its possible, you can maybe you can consider a PT job after graduating"
NovelInspection7375,1,"Hello friend! I am  from one of the first few batches and came from a poly with biology and physics background, no other experience except for 6mtn internship in which i needed to visit multiple hospitals for  non-DR related work. It's definitely gotten more competitive although i dont know why considering our manpower shortage is almost crisis level.  

Why are you interested in this? 

For the money - there are other way better paying jobs. 

Looks fun / be a Healthcare Hero - write in to a few DR clinics (in orchard/private hospitals), polyclinics as well as gov hospitals and ask if you could job shadow for a few hours. If you like it you could even request to extend to be a Radiography Assistant and put it in your course application. Talk to the radiographer and ask for their honest opinion of the job, the good and the bad. Dont let them sugarcoat it for you because any time you invest in something and regret it, is time lost. 

At the end of the day, DO YOUR RESEARCH. Do not assume a job is anything like its portrayed by the companies looking to hire people. Ask the people on the gound, gather their feedback and draw a concensus from it. This works for all jobs / endeavours you may undertake. Just like how you always read reviews before trying a new restaurant, dont make a mistake in choosing your uni course."

HlliedAealthStudent,3,"For point 1, we have quite a rigorous curriculum due to the Trimester system. A typical 4 year SIT course will require 240 credits to graduate, you can compare that to other Unis' 4 year courses which typically require a min 160 or less to graduate. 

We are similar to other Unis in the sense that we have similar study weeks (13/14 weeks) per semester/trimester, so no we are not slower paced."
SpongeBobBobPants,4,"1. We exchange months of accumulated ""missing"" semester breaks for quicker graduation. If you notice, although Pharm Eng is a 4 year course. Our 4th year only consist of 1 trisem. Studying pace is the same, in fact, the lack of sem breaks in-between is pretty mental draining.


2. Depending on your poly modules, you could get exemption from modules such as Chemistry etc. You would have to apply for it and pass some test in order to exempt from modules.


3. Depends. Exempted modules *are not* counted inside GPA. If you think you can get A for Chemistry in Pharm Eng, then don't exempt because that can pull up your GPA. However, if you feel that you cannot take the load, you can exempt the module to focus on other modules.


4. Engineering modules are tough and there are tons of applications. Lecturers are generally helpful and willing to teach.


5. Took my interview > 5 years back so can't comment on this. But I could tell you what are some of the questions that I got through DM if you want."
iKeelMellow,3,"1. SIT pace is pretty fast IMO e.g. 1 chapter in poly takes 1 week while 1 chapter in SIT is 1 lecture. As others have mentioned, SIT courses are ""accelerated"" and you can think of it as a 4 year chem eng course condensed into 3 year + 1 trimester.
2. There's a minimum gpa requirement of 3.5 GPA before you can apply for mod exemption and it's still dependent on your grade for the mod so there's 2 criterias.
3. It really is dependent on how well you're able to cope as you're expected to take 1-2 extra mod per sem
4. Prof generally are helpful and materials provided are sufficient to score an A 
5. Mostly general questions such as why do you want to take this course etc. May ask why are you moving from science to engineering and your portfolio will be taken into consideration to some extent."
Youareanoobie,5,"Current Pharm Eng student here

1. I've seen a lot of people answer it and tbh I cant help much so yeah I'm just gna skip this

2. Yes. Iirc you can skip bio and chemistry if you pass the test (one of them is something like your Quest grades must be 80%)

3. Personally as a guy I wouldn't want to risk exempting modules just so I can have a ""lighter workload"" for the first tris. Even though I found most modules quite easy I took them as revision as well as a way to get used to uni life faster (cause remember you're gna go through a lot of tris so the faster you can get used to SIT's style and pace of learning, the easier you'll manage uni life)


4. I find the lecturers to be really approachable here in Pharm Eng. Most of them will not hesitate to help you and will even let you know their emails on your first few days so you can contact them for any doubts. However, linking this point abit to point 5, I think some traits interviewers are looking for is your resourcefulness and ability to think for yourself. In a sense, be a thinker and not just a follower. Dont show that you're just gna keep relying on the lecturers to help you understand what you know or dont know cause it may put you in a bad light. Instead, what you would want to show is that you can rely on other things (google, youtube, friends, etc) to get your info from

The longer internship period also means you’ll get to learn more and be there to experience most of the company’s project lifecycle.

Bad thing is, although theres many companies onboarded in this IWSP, most top-tier companies like Google/Meta/McKinsey/BCG don’t have internships lasting this long, which means u can’t go for these for your IWSP."

NovelInspection7375,3,"Hello a graduate here!  To get the sppnsorshis is ratehr easier especially if you have average grades at least. Just write in to any hospital or talk to your lecturer thats working at a hospital you are interested in. They usually can refer you and even get a onboarding bonus. 

Important question is, have you done any attachments anywhere yet? 

If yes, really think through which you prefer, private or public. Consider both in terms of workload, quality and quantity of colleagues, management style (boots on the ground vs NATO), future endeavours opportunities (modality, masters, phd), staff turnover rates. These are just some ways to tell if a place is worth bonding too. 


 If no, I would strongly advise you to do write in to yur lecturer to request to clear both a private hospital and a public hospital attachment quickly before deciding. Remember, a sponsorship means you are BONDED for 2 to 5 years. 

I understand if you really are cash-strapped and circumstances are against you. But if possible, make sure you have worked at the place you intend to take a sponsorship from at the very least, lest you end up in a toxic workplace and drag your feet to work everyday. 

If circumstances are good, I'd advise you not to take a sponsorship at all, HSS jobs are abundant due to the severe lack of manpower. Don't tie yourself down to a place right from the start incase in y2 or 3 of studies you decide to drop out or change course. After you graduate you might even decide to do another line of work, or post grad, phd, masters etc. 

Work just enough hours, to make just enough money, to do what you love. 


Good luck!"
Fit_Confusion_4192,2,"Hi i'm a Y3 Nursing student. I don't know about the sponsorship part for other HSS courses but I can tell you the difference between government and private hospital though it's from a nurse perspective after working for 2 years. 


Government hospital - Lower base salary but bonus are just chef's kiss! Can enjoy government benefits though patient load is very high. Promotion for nurses is more or less systemic now. 


Private hospital - Higher base salary (at least 1-2k difference) but bonus is just meh, really depends on your performance. No government bonus (aka the 4k bonus government gave out last 2 years) but workload is significantly lesser than gov hospital. Not sure about promotion though. 


If you are keen for sponsorship with private hospitals, you can find out more at their website. They are always offering sponsorships! 


Getting sponsorship is a great way to support yourself while studying though you need to really find out about the work environment of the hospital you're signing with, if not you're gonna regret it (like I did). My suggestion is to ask around about the different hospitals beforehand and maybe go for attachments first if possible. 


All the best for your sponsorship hunting! :)"

Under university of glasgow. Note the employment rates and mean salary.

Then,

[SIT GES 2021](https://www.google.com/url?sa=t&source=web&rct=j&url=https://www.moe.gov.sg/-/media/files/post-secondary/ges-2021/web-publication-sit-ges-2021.ashx%3Fla%3Den%26hash%3D30954423BABC54974ED3F524EC8825430D4889E1&ved=2ahUKEwjo4N3roc77AhUz1zgGHasoDGoQFnoECBUQAQ&usg=AOvVaw2GEl8tO3THr5bz8bgivpac)

Note how the sit software engineering course jumped up in employment rate and mean salary by a huge amount. This means both ges vary wildly even though they're only a year apart.

On the other hand, where did the computing science go? maybe they forgot to include it.

Thus, ask the school through their admissions email on the difference as to software engineering and glasgow computing science, because it's hard to compare them when computing science is not even in the recent ges for some reason. It's better to ask what's the difference.

But yeah. Also, computing science is a 180 credit course of 3 years, software engineering is a 4 year course. Just a matter of consideration as well.

But computing science by itself should be just computer science. 

As for computer science and game design or computer science in rtis, those are geared more toward those who want to go into games. Can be seen from employment rates too, since game companies are more selective than normal companies. While not saying you can't go into other companies(rtis tend to look into other companies compared to cs in gd, which is why their employment rates are higher and mean salary higher as well since game companies tend to pay less), the course itself is considered very demanding.


Anyways all this is to say sit has 2 computer science courses you can go into, one joint degree with uni of glasgow(3 years), the other one being a 4 year course. Apparently the software engineering course has like 98% employment rate long term as of 2021, with a high salary. This is waaay higher than the year before, for the same course, for some reason. As of computing science being in ges 2020, i wouldn't refer to ges 2020 as being recent information given the drastic change in the other course.

Tldr2; email the admissions office. Also unless you're really sure to go into games, taking digipen courses for CS is tougher and more specialised."

For physiology, it's more important to understand the content rather than rely on memory work. 

Imo since it's MCQ, memory work is probably just 40% since you need to remember jargon and some details, but majority will come from your understanding of the topic. 

Break down the info into bite sized chunks, and then try to reason and piece them all together. 

If you can't understand some concepts or topics, go rewatch the lecture or some youtube videos. 

The rest just comes down to MCQ strats. 

The same can be said for psych, but it might require slightly more memory work due to the different theories and all, but in essence it's the same."

imo best thing you can do with your free time from now is to apply as an OT/PT assistant. It lets you know if the jobs are really for you, and also gets your some form of experience to pad your portfolio.

By right SIT campus is not open to the public, and neither is the library. ~~though no one is stopping you from waltzing in since the library doesn't have a requirement to scan in~~

Most important tip imo, is to make your first choice count.

Traditional_End_3317,5,"Year 2 physio student here. My admission interview day was:
1) A short essay (30 min iirc) on your thoughts on replacing domestic helpers with robots
2) A group discussion (15-20 min I think?) with like 5 other candidates on our thoughts on replacing healthcare workers with robots
3) Read a short scenario about your best friend secretly stealing the main role in some drama performance despite claiming to support you in getting it, then verbally answering some questions asked about how you would deal with the situation 
4) Read a short scenario in which you are in charge of distributing milk powder to single parents. Then meet (physically, face-to-face) with a standardised patient acting as a parent who’s actually not single, but asking for milk powder to feed her baby, her husband is paralysed by stroke and she is the sole breadwinner. Then talk to her depending on what you choose to do (I told her I would help her buy some milk powder myself, as she said she needed to feed her baby that very same day)
5) Interview with a senior principal physiotherapist eg. tell me about yourself, why you want to be a physio, what are your thoughts on the importance of protecting patient data and privacy (I think it was shortly after that health data leak happened) and some stuff I don’t rmb anymore haha

Got my acceptance letter in about 2 weeks I think. 

As for familiarity with course content I think your best bet is really looking at the list of modules and module descriptions on the SIT website? Just be aware of what modules you will be taking and roughly what things you will be learning? 

Overall I think keep yourself well-read on recent major health topics (possibly Singapore’s readiness and handling of pandemics such as Covid-19? - This was my health systems module essay topic), your reasons for wanting to become a therapist (even now I’m still getting asked this for other SIT interviews lol) eg. what you want to do for patients, and you should do fine. 

All the very best to you!"

Clarify everything if it doesn't line up with your expectations. You could ask the same questions across orgabisation and compare their answers. 

Most importantly is to read between the lines in how they describe their job/colleagues etc as this will give u a good sensing of the type of work environment and culture you will be integrating into.

Mintchococake00,2,"Hello panicking poly y3 student,

First take a deep breath. Don't worry too much HAHAHA. Whatever I'm gonna say is based on my knowledge as a current Food Tech student in SIT so take it with a pinch of salt.

1. After you apply, there will be a video assessment (I enrolled during COVID period so it was an online video interview). Unfortunately, I can't really remember the questions, but it's usually the obvious ones like why did u choose food science, tell me more about yourself etc. 
2. Yes of course you have wayyyy more experience than my poly experience AHHAHA. As far as I know, this course only requires a minimum poly GPA of 3.0, and SIT tends to favour applicants with relevant work experience. Your internship experience, competition achievement and 3.5 GPA makes you 99% likely to be able to get an offer for the video interview so you definitely don't have to worry about this part
3. Yes there will be an video assessment. Some kind of software will flash you a question, you have 5 seconds to think, then the software will start recording to your answer. So there is no live interviewer. However, I have heard that some applicants had to do an interview with some of the professors, and I'm not sure if it will be physical or online since I only had to do the video assessment.
4. The shorter breaks really do suck HAHAHA I tend to work part time during my poly holidays, but the trimester breaks are too short that I just nua at home until the trimester begins. As compared to poly schedule, in my personal opinion, there's almost no difference other than the higher difficulty of the content you are studying. I still think that nothing I experience in uni so far can beat the stress of my final semester in poly (maybe my final year in uni will be hell but we shall see. And if you manage your time well (dont leave your assignments to the last minute hor), the stress is relatively manageable.Also, one other thing is that lectures are recorded. So I don't have to drag myself to school at 9am everyday which I feel contributed to making uni more manageable. As a night owl, having to attend classes physically at 9am then having project discussions in the afternoon/evening was really tiring for me back in poly. In uni now, I could at least dedicate some days to focus on projects, and some days to focus on catching up on lectures.
5. As long as your diploma is a food science diploma from SP/NYP/TP, you are eligible for direct Y2 entry. Whatever you specialise in poly shouldn't matter.
6. There is no assigned companies. There will be a career portal where you choose 3 companies you are interested in to apply, and based on your resume, all 3 companies may or may not interview you. This is to simulate you finding a full time job in the future.

Hope it helps :) Do dm me if you need more clarifications"

Not the most coherent due to the campus situation but it's still active if you seek for it

>pay

You can get a gauge of the pay through the GES. Iirc for ICT courses, the starting salaries has been consistently climbing year on year and last year, it is almost on par with the ICT courses from NUS/NTU.

Iirc ICT courses are based in SIT@NYP but I'm not a 100% on that"
kaleidostar11,3,"Let's be honest here, most people chose SIT because they didn't get into the big 3. But if your GPA isn't in the 3.85 range/ A levels, AAA/A,  then it's quite foolish to do that comparison in the first place. I've seen plenty of clowns with a GPA of 3.5 asking if it's any good to pick SIT instead of the big 3.

Don't get me wrong 3.5 is a pretty good GPA already, but IT courses are competitive.  It's literally the best choice you have. (stupid to consider options u don't have) Have you seen what it's like for private uni?

But does it mean that SIT is not recognised? GES for 2021 shows a median pay of $5k for SIT ICT students which is already pretty decent. Most importantly, it has been sg's 5th autonomous university since 2014.

Not trying to discredit private uni students, but it is a known fact that private students have much lower starter salaries and are much closer to a poly diploma holder's salary and have limited financial assistance and subsidies.

With the main campus ( centralised ) ready at Punggol in 2024, you can expect better student life, activities and university identity."

I will explain this to you but if you havemore question on this you can attend the open house in jan at suntec.

1. SIT is a local uni. 
2. Pros
   1. Higher internship pay
   2. Faster to graduate for degree
   3. Able to attend local university events without most of the competition
   4. Faster employment (most graduate are from poly)
   5. Able to use most of the poly facilities 
3. Cons
   1. Trimester
   2. Mediocre school culture & facilities 
   3. OU (overseas partner university)
   4. not all degree is the same
   5. School politics (from class to cca or hosting events)
4. For campus we are located around various poly. So it vary from from your major is it a OU-SIT degree or SIT degree. This will determine a lot of things"

1. I believe there was a Math/physics optional bridging module before the first school term started. That would help brush up on your physics somewhat. In the actual curriculum physics was taught in 1-2 modules. I believe that would be under Foundations of Physio: Movement now. The content is mostly on vectors and forces. Also one of the very few mods we needed a calculator for exam. I also was not confident in the subject but I managed okay.
2. Go ahead, the physics is really not as daunting as the biology content (anatomy and physiology are the foundations for any physio). Not to scare you, but the NUS profs who taught A&P actually said the content was much more rigorous than NUS students lol. Other bio-heavy modules include pharmacology, neurobiology and exercise physiology. You should be able to thrive here.
3. Physiotherapy itself is a very niche subject. Most of the students study with the aim to become physios. I know people who have gone on to do stuff with similar skill sets in outpatient rehab or sports/personal training fields but I have not heard of alumni going on to do medicine. But there were students with medical background coming to do physio.That being said I think physios are also doctors in a sense, just that we focus on movement. The types of assessment and intervention doctors and outpatient musculoskeletal physios do are similar on some levels. And when you work at hospitals wearing scrubs and carrying a stethoscope (physios treat respiratory conditions as well - they do auscultations for the lungs) you chuckle when patients refer to you as doctors.

Hope this helps!  


Edit: With the focus on tech now there's also a compulsory online introductory module to coding/AI/tech. Optional for our cohort but I did try it out a bit. Content wasn't too technical but something to keep in mind."

Also, not all classes have a participation component. Even if there is, each prof would have their own way of assessing participation. In my experience, only a handful of profs assess class involvement.

Basically, they're full time employees taking a 5-year undergrad degree (instead of us taking 3 years). They only take 3 mods per tri, but at the pace of full time students. All I can say is that it takes a toll on them HAHAH especially when most of them have families to juggle, on top of school *and* full time work. They struggle a lot, and the profs kinda set a slightly lower bar of expectations for their projects. I can assure you that they're barely coming out alive at the end of the trimester, aiming for an at least 2.0 GPA out of 5.0.

However for your case, you would take the full load of mods, but at the same time you would also have the full access to support (regardless if prof consultations, classmates to depend on, or resources you can get from others) that the CBWL students don't. 

I also can't vouch for the pressure ICT students are under, but at the end of the day it really depends on you as the individual and your circumstances.

2) the study plan is not something you must definitely follow, it's just a guide for you to complete your studies. basically you plan which modules you want to take during each tri, there should be a document that says which mods are available during which tri. you must include all compulsory mods in your study plan and then submit it, where they'll then give you feedback on whether it's feasible or not etc.

 3) i wasn't a direct y2 but i'm pretty sure it's the same for everyone; your timetable can be flexible as you have to bid for mods, so basically you can choose which timings you want. you could go to school everyday or have 1-2 days off depending on the mods. also now it's mostly physical lessons, occasionally depending on the situation the lecturer may choose to have online sessions.

Not all mods have class participation components. If there is, in Week 1 the prof will set their expectations of what they want to see. Usually 10%, but not hard to hit imho."
kaleidostar11,1,"For students in the ICT cluster, there are no class participation marks for core modules. Marks are given to lab work/assignments(5-10%). Some of the modules require compulsory attendance while some are optional, but majority of the people still don't skip classes for a good reason."
kaleidostar11,4,"Unlike the other courses with high acceptance rates like engineering and digipen(high dropout rate), IGP for 2020 DCIM shows 7.1% for GPA below 3.2.

Just apply and improve your chances by having a stacked portfolio. But if you do nothing to improve your chances drastically, I would say having a GPA of 2.3-2.5, the chance of getting an offer is close to 0. You can consider applying with more working experience or taking relevant courses to pivot into another course."

92347220,2,"Just go for one week then when they ask you to pay school fees request for it ah.

Cause iirc, the first week usually is for you to get accustomed to their pace and won't charge you for the first week."
Gold-Aspect6755,5,"Hello! Not sure how different it is between courses but here are my responses as an ICT student:

*Can I know the difference between Lecture and Tutorial?*  
Lectures are conducted at cohort-level (so all 300 or so students together) over Zoom or in a lecture theatre. These are mass 2-3h sessions with the Prof where the majority of the content will be covered. Tutorials are in much smaller groups (20 students maybe) and these are for more hands-on assignments after the lecture for the week. If your course is like ICT and has lots of projects, your project groupings will likely be with the people within your tutorial/practical classes as well.

*What should one take note when planning our school schedule?*  
Lectures happen at fixed timings since they're the same for all. So usually you can only plan your tutorials/labs where applicable.

* My biggest priority is obviously the timing, I'd rather have morning lessons than very late afternoon ones.
* If you have a mix of online and physical lessons (can identify them based on the location stated in in4sit), I'd like to group all my online lessons on one day and physical lessons on the rest if possible so you won't have to rush to school after an online lecture or vice versa. But this is highly dependent on what are your choices for each module so may not always be possible.
* Harder for Y1T1, but for future tris once you know more profs/seniors can ask around and decide which prof to pick for the lessons. Again you won't have a choice for the lectures but might for the tutorials/labs.

*Can I add module load when I am in Y1T2? Is it advisable?*  
Again this is for ICT. Usually, if you come from poly you'll minimally get 2-3 module exemptions in Y1 (ICT1001, ICT1006, maybe ICT1010). So you can take some Y2 modules in advance (i.e. ICT2901, ICT2902) and I highly suggest you do so. But I believe there's usually a cap of 5 modules/tri. I wouldn't suggest taking more than that either tbh, 5 is already horrible enough :)

Hope this helps! Feel free to DM if you need any more info. Welcome to uni op!"
gwnaf,2,"Helloo, welcome to OT ! :D l’m currently in y1 OT, and I’ll try my best to answer your questions !! There are some common mods with the entire hss mostly in tri 1 and 2 of y1, but I think I can mostly speak for my experience in ot. 

General timetable outline 
- for tri 1 and 2, mostly online lectures are on Mon/ tue, while tutorials are usually wed-Fri. Depending on your schedule for NUS anatomy hall schedule, you may have to go to NUS on fri or sat

Start and end timings
- it varies every week, but the earliest class usually starts at 9am and the latest class usually ends by 6pm. 

Are there lessons everyday ?
- Nope, but it really depends on your timetable and tutorial class. But that being said, classes usually don’t stretch across a whole day unlike in jc. I think on an average day we probably would go to school for 1-2 tutorial classes (1 tutorial = 2h) 

Is it a mix of online and physical lessons ?
- yeps ! But I think Covid was probably a contributing factor for the hybrid arrangement, I’m not sure if the prof would be keeping this arrangement for the incoming freshies 

On a whole, I think the incoming y1 OTs may have a slightly different experience as we had a dialogue session with the profs recently and they mentioned revamping the y1 modules for OT so probably could keep an open mind !! HAHAHA"

Surface pro is neither good as a laptop nor a tablet. It aspires to be both but turns out to be neither.

Invest in a proper, solid laptop if you're gonna commit to it for the next 3 to 4 years, through your IWSP and capstone project.

Personally, a tablet is a nice-to-have although I'm aware there are some camps of people that think it's a must-have. If you think it would 110% supplement your learning, do take a look at prev gens of Samsung Tabs or 2nd-hand iPads with decent storage."
ExistingImage2437,1,If you want to buy a macbook you have to consider getting it with parallels or dual booting it with windows. Most programs only work with windows.

>I understand Uni life is all about independant learning, proactiveness etc. but what if we are really lacking in the particular subject?

Profs sometimes will teach under the impression that you have your basics in place from your diploma because there is *a lot* to cover in one lecture or tutorial.

HOWEVER they are always willing to teach if you ask or schedule a consultation. It's probably because they're PhD holders who are actively involved in research within a field that they're teaching, so they're very familiar even if you throw them a difficult question. Even if they can't teach well, they will commit themselves to answering your questions, which I treasure a lot.

Also, there's a usual mix of good and not so good profs, just like all the teachers you've ever had. Don't worry to much!"
Far_Outcome_2135,2,"hmm, honestly depends. if youre lucky, u get really nice profs that are not only knowledgeable in their field but are teacher material. they are the sort that are v patient and can explain n u GEDDIT, and some even reply to our emails at 12am kind (crazy ik). 

 well if not, then u get profs that tbf are knowledgeable but not so much the teaching material, and so their explanation is ""???"". some you can feel they're there cus its a 9-5pm thing, so when they explain its like ""might as well dont? 😭"" - thats when you fall back on ur friends and digest prof's explanation tgt or google RIP. 

i'd say baseline is, most of em will be willing to help you thru consultation/emails etc (as they shd). it just to varying degrees on how helpful it is. having said, u shd do some homework n come prepared with questions to ask. if u go in there expecting them to spoonfeed, generally they will not.

Also, SEEMS had a 70% requirement to pass a module but Mechatronics now has changed it to 50%, so I'm sure more people would see through the course than last time.

If you're facing imposter syndrome, just remember that SIT has filtered through tens of thousands of applicants each year for only ~3000 slots. By now, I'm sure they would be familiar in their selection of undergraduates, and they offered you a spot.

Bond free, but obviously you must score well (I think >= 4.0?) and be involved in student life 

(2) MOE and External Bursaries

MOE one is kinda straight forward but the donated bursaries look at your PCI, GPA (I think they're much more flexible on this bc my classmate got <4.0 but still got it), and requires an interview. I went through once, and the first question was literally ""why should we give you this bursary, on top of your MOE bursary"" LMAO. Then they'll ask if you get allowance, how you spend your money every month, if you work etc.

Just FYI, the time between approval and payout takes a bit of time. The first window bursary was only disbured on 31 October last year.

(3) SIT Work-Study Scheme

SIT has paid student assistant roles. Some examples are Research Assistants, Lab Assistants, Project Roles (app dev, conduct medical interviews, mechanical design for ongoing project) etc. and the pay is anywhere from $10 to $15 per hour. There is a portal for this, but you can always ask your Programme Leader if he or his peers need student assistants bc sometimes they don't publicise it. Payout every mid and end-month.

(4) Gig work

PT work is possible but given SIT's fast pace, I'd recommend you get a feel of your workload first. My classmates who do food delivery stopped going to work after recess week because there's barely time to breathe. So what do they is spend the trimester break and first few weeks of the tri to work as much as they can, then slowly burn their savings until the next tri break comes.

(5) Assistance for Minorities

For Malays, you can apply for Mendaki TTFS for your *basic* school fees. You can also try to apply for LBKM's bursaries.
For Indians, you guys can check out SINDA's bursaries and study loans.

EDIT:
(6) CPF Education Loan Scheme

There is a limit to how much of your parent's CPF you can draw for education. Details should be on CPF website. IIRC 1 year after graduation, you will need to pay cash monthly back to your parent's CPF account so they continue to use it for retirement.

(7) PSEA

You can call the PSEA hotline to see how much money is left in it. NSMen should have received a top up after ORD. If you still have money in it and did not use it in poly/JC before, you should follow the matric guide to set up a standing order

Honestly the Quests on xSite helps you warm up for school. This is especially for guys who just came out of NS, or people in technical fields like engineering who *needs* to brush up math and physics fundamentals (hence math and physics quests) before school starts. Not compulsory despite the endless reminders they send, but I'd say it was very helpful to me (albeit a little demotivating bc it was basic math and physics but I was struggling HAHAHA).

thestickbunsen,5,"Not from ICT but Engineering.

SIT past year papers are considered contraband! They do not publicly archive past year papers and it's illegal to possess them (unless you got connections sksksk)

You'll only have access to tutorials or any teaching guides they provide. In Week 1 of every tri, profs will show the textbooks they use for reference. You can try to find digital copies of those textbooks on sites like [libgen](https://libgen.is/) to have access to wayyy more questions and sometimes even answer keys to your tutorials.

The idea is for students to internalise the concept at its core, and apply this understanding to any problem they throw at you.

Not sure if this applies to UoG based modules tho. Hope this helps!"
thestickbunsen,8,"Mine was last year, and yes it's cluster specific. I'm from Engineering.

I don't fully recall but IIRC there was an SIT tote bag, some cluster brochures, and a red Swiss Army-like Knife with the words ""Engineering"" and ""SIT"" printed on the plastic panels of the knife.

Then like 1 week before Day Zero we got a another package. It had a Day Zero tshirt that you had to wear for orientation, a matte black SIT insulated bottle with a built-in digital thermometer in the cap, sticky candy, and some other stuff.

Our matriculation card was by singpost last year but for this year, what I heard is that it will be a physical collection on 20th Aug together with University Life Club Fair.

Edit: Some accountancy students enrolling this year actually got a webcam from SIT LOL idk how or why they received it before the first window even closed but yeah"

ahNIC96,2,From what I can remember they did test for colour blindness not sure will it affect your matriculation. First they will test your height and weight and urine. So drink plenty of water before going to the clinic to avoid wasting time. After that a consultation with the doctor like testing your blood pressure and color blindness test. Should be quite fast if no other people waiting. But they will ask u to go for a xray in other clinic in the central on the same day after that you will be done. Do Pm me if you have any other questions. Hope that help and All the best !

thestickbunsen,1,"Does your unrelated diploma require the use of maths, like calculus?"
eddyyjh,1,"Hi TS! It is nice to hear you are considering EDE as your choice of study! From what I understand, they do consider mature applicants as well. It is a plus point. Most importantly, the interviewers want to know is why do you choose this course of study. Perhaps TS might wanna share why over here!

As compared to its predecessor course EEIT, now candidates from non-articulated diploma (i.e. non-engineering) are considered as well, as long as one has the aptitude or interest in mathematics and physics. The TUM modules rely heavily on these fundamentals as you will be using math to model applications, depending on which module you are studying for. It may be challenging at the start, but it trains your logical and critical thinking skills. At the same time, programming skills are taught in the course as well. I do not know of the latest curriculum now, but you can check SIT's site for your own reference.

For technical interview wise (based off my previous experience), you might be tested on scenario-based questions, mathematics (trigonometry/functions/calculus etc.) and physics-based/circuit theory-based questions. One more thing, the German Professors do not really look at your poly GPA. They can fail your interview if your fundamentals are not strong.

What I can recommend is for you to pick up calculus on your own to prepare yourself for the technical interview if you get selected. Best of luck!"
SpongeBobBobPants,1,"Hope this reply ain't too late.

Lecture notes are uploaded online, so it's up to you whether you want to print it out or doodle up on your laptop.

Projects, 1x Mid term and 1x Final exam are the assessment component for a typical module. Final year will be mostly project-based assessment. 

Because of trimester, our term breaks are short (2-3 weeks max). So charge up ASAP, and don't be like me (Holiday mode still on even after new tri starts)."

No interview = not shortlisted. You are on the right track to gain experience and build portfolio before trying again."

thestickbunsen,19,"*tl;dr uni is tough with many projects. Start early, work smart, you can do it. Find a work/study style most effective for yourself. However, don't drown. Dont forget to enjoy school. Atb.*

Context: Student from Engineering Cluster. Ymmv as it varies course-by-course, but just sharing my thoughts and experience. I want to open my thoughts with... it's all about working smart. Very cliché, but hear me out.

As the other commenters have said, SIT doesn't have exam study week like other unis do. This means that you must plan to study for your finals as early as week 6. Why? Anytime after recess week, you will be bombarded by mid terms and project deliverables. The moment the project brief is released, you must start reading up. There is no such thing as ""starting too early"" (dont trust people who say it is). I took this advice to heart, and I believe that this is what allowed me to stay afloat (mostly) while others struggle to do so.

Next, you gotta accept that you can't be good at everything. Since the trimester system is so fast paced, you have to re-prioritise your work every other week. Find people who can do work and stick with them. Ask profs anything and everything under the sun for a hint of what they look for in an A+ report, ask the seniors what were their struggles so you can mitigate them, and ask the top scorers how they plan on tackling the project. The insights into their thought process and direction is much more valuable than just working hard to produce work. For lectures/tutorials, *please pre-read them* and watch videos on YouTube about some of the concepts before coming to class. You will strain your brain MUCH lesser when actually sitting for the lecture. Experiment different study techniques and find what's best for you.

Culture-wise, I have yet to see any ""snake culture"" here in SIT most probably because everyone is drowning themselves LOLOL.

Most importantly, don't forget to slow down! In my tri 1.1, I slaved like crazy, neglecting my time with people around me. I did really well but 4 months felt like a blur which sucked. So in 1.2 I dedicated at least 2 hours of solid free time everyday. It did add a little pressure because that is time that could be used to do research, but eventually I realised that my mind was clearer for longer periods which helped a lot (there are research papers regarding the effectiveness of dedicating time to not-studying). The point here is, don't forget to enjoy school. Your 1.1 might be a culture shock of how fast things move in school, but slow down and actually process your week instead of blazing through it. Also, please *dont* take tri 1.1 as a trial. Your first ever GPA sets the tone for the rest of your study. I have classmates who took it easy in tri 1.1 because they ""just wanna get warmed up to uni"" but now they're struggling to pull up their cGPA.

And finally, like what me and my classmates tell ourselves when the going gets tough, ""we're working for a degree, of course it'll be difficult"". Dont worry about difficulty of studies because it definitely will be LMAO but it's about how adept you are at overcoming them, which is the skillset needed in the industry.

All the best, and welcome to SIT :)"

SameAd5763,1,when does the first window close?
eddyyjh,2,"Hi Junior! I am not from EDE per se but I am from its predecessor course, EEIT. I am in my final year and graduating this year. I have to say the course had went through a revamp since 2020, mainly to cater to the Industry's needs. From what I heard, you will have 50% of the courses taken by SIT's faculty and the other 50% taken by the TUM faculty. 

I concur with thestickbunsen. The TUM modules are generally challenging and it places alot on the fundamentals of mathematics. From what I heard, alot more than what the local EE curriculum offers. And yes, alot of algebra involved. This is part and parcel of Engineering education. Especially with the rise in Data Science and Machine Learning, you will need the math to get into this field. At the same time, you will be picking up a great deal of programming I believe.

For grading wise, you will sit for a single exam and you will get your grade, unless specified otherwise. Your counterparts in Germany are also doing the same thing. However, you do not need to worry. The lecturers will guide you through. Be curious and be willing to learn, but of course the pace can be quick so you must be prepared to pick up things quickly. Ask questions in class if you have to clarify. A tip is to form study groups and help one another. Lastly, practice makes perfect!

Perhaps you can clarify with your direct EDE seniors or your Program Director if you have any more doubts, when you officially start school! I wish you the very best in your Journey into EDE. Viel Glück!"
thestickbunsen,1,"Not from EDE but I have a few friends there. From what I've heard/seen, TUM EDE gotta be one of the toughest courses in the engineering cluster.

Math with no numbers (purely alphabets!), math test with no calculators, high weightage finals and very limited time to study (for trimesters hosted by TUM). Similar to other courses, people who signed up for uni ""just for the degree"" without understanding the work required to put in burns out fast. However, do take this with a grain of salt. Obviously I would only hear the extreme highs and lows and people don't really share the mundane weekly stuff.

Also, SIT is revamping the curriculum for many engineering courses next year so if your seniors pulled their strings right, things might be better for you guys in the coming AYs.

All the best!"

Edit: If you make friends with the right people, you can actually gain a huge advantage in terms of having reference for previous years materials, project briefs, etc."
alllllllllllllllly,3,I won’t put your hopes too high but my friend just received his online interview on 1st May and is now awaiting his results (his GPA being 2.xx). I’d say just wait until an email is really sent out to you and in the worst case scenario just try to appeal
tmpze8,2,same bro did f2f interview for accountancy in late april and no news till now
Regirock9,2,Prepare for appeal alr

Busy-Statistician-77,2,Just keep checking your addmision website for the status
190821,1,hello! i got the confirmation letter 4 days after accepting my offer tho. did you click confirm again after selecting the course in the joint admissions portal?
Alert-Ad-55,1,I did the interview on 22nd March and only got offered around 12 30 today. Did you submit the transcript yet? Looks like they wait for the transcript. Submitted my transcript with the diploma cert on Thursday. Good luck hope you get it. Btw what course did you apply for?

STUDENTZYH,2,Bro. Don't worry . Can appeal if u got rejected. Currently study in mdme( y2 )got a few frens of mine appeal and got in
Appropriate-Cake6833,2,"Hihi! I’m just gna throw a bunch of info and hopefully it answers ur qns haha XD

Currently in my y1 in SIT Accountancy and studies has been hectic so far due to the school being trimester based. As someone who does not come from a relevant diploma in poly (did tourism related dip in poly), I was only able to exempt 4 mods in total. Some of my peers have to take 6 mods for both year 1 tri 1 and tri 2 which was pretty tough and a prof stated in our orientation that ideal would be around 4 modules per tri due our studies being pretty content heavy. 

However, I’m pretty sure new intake (current batch) has a different curriculum that is adjusted to make it better suited for students. (https://www.singaporetech.edu.sg/undergraduate-programmes/accountancy) The school made adjustments such as combining some modules together and also changing the credit unit of certain modules. Current students are able to choose their classes and it’s a plus point cuz u can just pick ur classes with friends haha XD there is a catch to choosing ur timetable like eg certain modules are only available in certain trimester thus u wld have to plan when u wld want to take up the class. I’m not sure whether new batch are able to choose their class tho u might have to email in to the school to ask :/ 

As for being good at numbers, I guess it would be a plus? Personally I’m not very good at it and I only took basic accounting and business statistics in year one of my poly and found it doable. However I ended up struggling in uni as I tend to leave all my studies to the week before the exam and thus did not do well in my first trimester. I have meet many ppl from my cohort who does not have accounting background (most in business, engineering etc) and they are fairing pretty well so really is how discipline and engage u are in lectures and tutorials. 

To add on, there are two classes right now for my batch. One would be lecture (2hours) and tutorial (2hours), the other is seminar based (4 hours). Lectures are currently conducted online via zoom and seminar are progressing to physical. Is quite shag ah hahaha but honestly I’m surviving due to having entertaining table mates :D

Now for CCA, most of my friends and I joined clubs (CSC for me). However I haven’t really been really active in it haha except for the occasional talks they hosted and stuff. Some CCA like sports would require student to be in the specific campus (https://www.singaporetech.edu.sg/life-at-sit) and most if not all of them have a insta page for u to get info from. 

Erm for accountancy it is held at dover campus (can’t rmb when Punggol is gna open prolly in 2 years?) but yea there is total of food places; one in canteen and another in the lounge near the AYE gate. Food is not that good :(  but recently they opened a few stalls haven’t tried those yet ahha. Plus side for me would be that the greenery area in the middle of the school plus the university tower. There is a small library at the tower area which is really conducive for studying and also tables around the tower as well that is great for group discussions. There is also a small gym at the student lounge if u like to workout aft classes and stuff. 

Love the location too. Can do shopping at Star Vista or eat at one north with friends if u have long lunch breaks hehe :DD"
stunvegetable,2,Are there any telegram group chats or discord channels I can join to connect with other SIT accountancy peers and seniors?
thestickbunsen,1,looks like no TUM offers have been released so far

nubbad,1,i know another person who got offered! he/she got the offer tdy via portal
SITing_onthe_fence,1,Hi! Any 1 matriculating into EDE this year?
thestickbunsen,2,"Ps but adding context would help a lot here.

What is the ideal course? What was offered? Your edu bg, interest, desired field of work (if any)? What current plans do you have in mind? What concerns do you have moving forward?"
WittyAd2108,1,You can appeal
thestickbunsen,1,"Appreciate the edit.

SIT Aerospace seems to have a focus on unmanned aerial systems like UAVs. Maybe they offered you this because of your DASE background? Since DASE is from SEEE.

I totally agree that the ASE pathway is more aligned with being an LAE, especially when the curriculum includes instructors from SIAEC that are LAEs themselves.

I would say that you should definitely try for an appeal and highlight your goal of being an LAE. Similarly, I stressed that my goal was to be a Chartered Railway Engineer when applying for my course (SIE Land) back in 2020 since the course I wanted is accredited for that pathway.

I'm not sure if getting an AML requires any kind of accredited degrees or what, and you should definitely drop an email to an [ASE](https://www.singaporetech.edu.sg/directory/faculty/eicher-low) or [Aerospace](https://www.singaporetech.edu.sg/directory/faculty/gianmarco-radice) faculty to clarify. If there's no requirements, you *probably* could take up the courses on your own after graduation.

For the appeal process I'm not a 100% sure but I think you would need to accept the offer to secure a position in the university first.

I wish you all the best :)"
wangzhezhihun,1,"Aerospace engineering can also become a LAE, however you'll be taking all the theory/practical tests again for 2-3 years after your degree. Which is why ASE is more suitable if your aim is LAE. Any senior can correct me if I'm wrong here, in ASE you're required to take ALL your caas papers in the mist of the programme because after you graduate, you'll be clocking your OJT hours for ~3 years before they send you for panel interview to obtain your license. So let's say if you enrol into aerospace engineering, you'll have to otot take all caas papers and you'll miss out that SAR-147 cert from SIAEC as well. In the event that you could not be employ by SIAEC after graduation, ST and Bombardier will also be your choices to become a LAE."

I would say that you should expect to be quick to think on your feet, they would ask simple personal questions to get to know what kind of person you are like and what your views are on certain things. So there’s no need to do research, just be yourself, be genuine and honest with the questions. Also please stay clam HAHAHAH, there’s a time limit to each question so if u panic u loose precious time that u have. I won’t tell you the specific questions etc as it might be unfair for other applicants so I hope that you will understand that. But from the bottom of my heart, I wish you all the best and hope to see you as a fellow course mate in SIT HB :)"
evarLasts,1,Hows the f2f/zoom interview like? What type of questions are the interviewers looking to ask?
SwimmingMost7294,1,"Hi considering SIT EPE, however I hope you are able to clear some questions that I have

I am interested in EEE courses but of course my gpa couldn't hit the cut off of NUS , NTU so I am trying sit but some concerns I have

1) This is the main concern I have which is  I saw that SIT EPE is not recognized under PEB and is not accredited. Does that mean it will be less recognizable in the engineering industry when I am searching for a job in the future? Because I am worried that if I were to enter SIT EPE and end up not getting a good job it will make me feel like I wasted my time there just because the cert is firstly not recognizable as compared to NUS , NTU , SUTD Engineering , secondly it is also not an accredited course which puts me in a more unfavorable position? lastly I seen a post saying that sit-ou courses are also more unfavourable to employers? 

2) How is the curriculum structured for the 2 years and 8 months? Mind sharing more on what u guys learn in depth , how much theory n practical? , how are exams like since I heard there is no bell curve?

3) If u had the choice to pick nus ntu or even sutd engineering would u pick those schools instead of sit?

4) There is an interview right for admission? How is the interview like?

&#x200B;

Thank you hope u are still active and able to answer these questions:)"

fleur0105,1,I have been to the video assessment for another course in SIT. Some of the question asked was why did u choose this course?

The trimester system is basically squeezing 3 semester into 1 year. If you don't have any exemptions, the workload is quite heavy."
NoSlipper,1,"I came from TP DFS too hahah, i think you're from my batch. If you can, i will advice exempting mods like DSAG and Math/stats if you did well. 

Otherwise, the workload is crazy. You barely have time for sleep, let alone social life. I exempted a few mods so i'm still managing decent. But my peers who are taking 5 mods per trimester all have it really tough, SIT is no joke. I recently asked one of my senior how he survived with 5 mods per sem, he told me he averages 2-3 sleeps a day lol. 

If you lost touch, i highly recommend getting back at it during your free time. It will come back to bite u if you think the content of 5 mods are fully absorbable in ~3 months (imo)"
asdfghjkl_jo,1,"yes, 3 CCAs are more than sufficient. if you have volunteer work, that'll be great to add in too. adding too much is never a bad thing, and do add in your scholarships and educational achievements and merits, no downside to selling yourself out when applying for uni (: 

certs of relevant courses can also be added if you think your poly course might not be relevant to what you're applying for and you want to gain more leverage. 
if you have a referral letter/ letter of recommendation (from internship, etc) do add in that as well

Another one is just search in YouTube - day in a life of a PT/OT and see their general job scope. There's also a SIT programme talk available on YouTube by the PT/OT programme directors to have a bit more info on what the course is like generally. 

Another one is to look at their modules - which one you'd enjoy doing. Both courses have very vastly different modules. PT has more technical modules, OT has more humanities modules 

Lastly, if you want to get in depth - - you can see the specialisation of the profession to see where you'd like to step into. PT /OT may have a lot of overlapping responsibility as first glance, but in their specialties, the role is extremely defined. Check which one interests you the most"
throwawayahstd,3,"I wasn’t sure if i wanted OT or PT until i actually got to work under both groups myself.

ultimately it’s what you find to be more meaningful for you. OT is meaningful, yes, you get to see a patient not being to hold a cup or whatever and practicing grip strengthening exercises until they can hold it with no issues. that can be rlly meaningful because they’re regaining as much independence as possible in their daily activities! but in OT, everything is very theoretically based like the holistic model you mentioned, which doesn’t appeal to me very much.

in PT, you get to see them from not being able to walk without the help of a walking aid (say a stroke case) until they can walk independently without an aid, without any facilitation whatsoever. that can be also vv rewarding.

find what resonates with you. for me, its PT."

Min CGPA 2.0 is required to graduate iirc. Falling below cGPA 2.0 for 3 trimesters will get you out of course.

The academic standards for grade D will  
be reviewed to ensure adequate attainment of learning outcomes.  
• The new system will apply to all letter-graded modules taken with effect from Academic  
Year (AY) 2021/22 Trimester 1, i.e., from 6 September 2021 onwards.  
• The passing grade for all modules is D grade (1.00 grade point), unless otherwise specified"

Hour-Ad1439,1,"Hello im currently in dr but y1 only lol. So i can only ans some of ur qns. 

About physics i can’t really speak for it because i have not taken that mod but according to a senior it is mostly algebra (apparently). Chemistry i also can’t say much. But for bio u are right, what they teach is more focused on the system level and less of the cellular level. The mod we take is called anatomy and physiology so we have to learn everything about the body like the muscles, the heart, the respiratory system, the gi tract (this is the anatomy part), the physiology part would be how these systems work or the structure of the diff muscles and their clinical applications. 

To ans your other qns. No, we are not medical practitioners. We can specialise in different areas of imaging like nuclear imaging, angiography or MRI etc. Although we learn to read the images and can aid the radiologist in diagnosis, we cannot diagnose. 

Lastly, job prospects in healthcare are pretty straightforward. Its similar across other healthcare occupations. U can branch out into 4 main categories which are Education, Clinical, Research and management. Subsequently, u move up the ranks to become senior radiographer etc.

I feel like dun be too scared about the physics or chem. There are a lot of people in the course who dun even have bio or physics background (including me), as long as u put in the hard work it’ll be ok. I hope i managed to ans some of your qns. :)"
throwawayahstd,6,"hi! y2 here, thanks for being interested in physio. if you were to enter physio next year you’d be the second batch of fully SIT-conferred degree in physio, so expect some kinks throughout your student years as the local faculty irons out and solidifies the structure of your degree. lessons are content heavy with much emphasis on practical skills and you need to be on the ball and keep up as much as possible otherwise everything will start snowballing and you’ll get rlly stressed. 

exams are very application-based. don’t expect to only memorise without understanding and get a good grade cos that doesn’t work here. you may have to change your study method and be flexible. what you learn here ideally should carry over to the workplace.

you can look up what we study on our school website. it’ll be a rollercoaster ride with shit tons of things to study/practice/assignments to complete while juggling our own commitments etc. you’ll get used to it. (i hope, more like numb alr lolol)

most of what we learn is very relevant and useful in the workplace, and the profs are constantly fine tuning the things we need to learn cos they’re practitioners who are keeping up to date with current practices (and therefore we need to be up to date with current research as well), but if u rlly like physio you’re in for the time of your lives.

please, please, PLEASE. read up thoroughly on this course and do your research before deciding if you want to join. 10% of the cohort dropout every year because it’s too tough for them/not what they want/not what they expect, so make sure this is what u want."
throwawayahstd,1,"if your question is whether or not we had covid positive cases within SIT, yes. if you read the provost’s email to us somewhere last week you would be aware that we had five isolated cases on campus. 

my friends and coursemates who were in close contact with the positive case in our batch were placed on LOA but they’ve all returned to school since. still not sure who’s the covid case haha.

take care and be safe, always wear your mask on campus if you’re not eating!"
Illustrious-Detail94,1,Can pm me a form of contact?
iKeelMellow,1,Being attentive to lectures and using active recall studying helped me a lot. Improving retention of knowledge which resulted in lesser time studying and more balance to lifestyle. Try that out.
In_His_Time,2,"They don't fully depend on academic grades. Things such as relevant work experience, credentials and preparation for your course also counts too. They may ask these questions during the interview itself, you can also attach them directly during the online admission exercise."
DisillusionedSinkie,2,"Yeah my GPA was rather low compared to my peers! Think I got in cause I had alotta SEAL points in TP and I did really well for the interview

And yes, definitely, a lot of workers do return to study"
throwawayahstd,1,"allied health applicants have to undergo MMI with like 5-6 stations that test you on case scenarios, likely to see how you’re able to employ empathy etc to handle them. heard my senior who entered in 2017 or 2018 had to thread beads through a string (we hypothesized that the examiner was looking at how patient the applicant was when carrying out this task!)"

ireallyhatedriving15,3,"Yes, and yes.

Unlike other uni, cca isn't compulsory. As long as you can handle your workload, can join multiple ones. I think in y1 I joined 6 diff ccas. But take note of your grades first and foremost"
uhveeahn,1,Asking the same question here
ireallyhatedriving15,3,"Which SIT campus?

If the main Dover campus, there's 3 ways:

1. One north MRT and walk to SIT (side gate).
2. Buona Vista MRT and take a bus at Exit D - take 196 (side gate), and 198 (back gate).
3. Kent Ridge MRT, walk and pass through NUH and NUS Medicine, to go to SIT (back gate)"
Leading_Mistake2012,2,"hi there! its not compulsory according to my friends (seniors), they say it’s a waste of time gg :/ so i didn’t do it too (going in this year)"

Illustrious-Detail94,1,"The approved my exemptions even though I never tried the test 😂

MacBook is not recommended for accounting as you won’t be able to use certain softwares"
noobmaster444,1,"abit late but i am a macbook user! (aside from certain softwares (most notably MS Access)), most of the other software required will run on macbook as well! 

However, with that said, windows is really a better workstation - and it will be best to familiarise yourself with the windows OS since you will experience alot of it during IWSP haha"
aberkongzi,1,I received an email from my programme manager saying that they’ll handle the timetable for me. Maybe it’s the same for your course?
In_His_Time,1,"Sadly there is no shortcut, what most of us do is either:

1. Manually add them in google calendar for easy reference
2. Timetable wallpaper
3. Print out in card format 

I myself do it in google calendar, I just need to do one week worth of lectures and tutorials and I just repeat them weekly till the end of the trimester."

Emergency-Use-2814,1,:D
obliviate_x,1,Glad to help!
throwawayahstd,8,"can’t speak for the course as i’m not from ede but i suppose you’re either located in dover or sp according to the website! that’s great because most ccas are conducted in the dover campus (unfortunately not with p2ha as most ccas, yes sports too, have shifted online).

sit degrees operate in a trimester manner - expect lesser holidays and more work within a 13-week study period in a trimester than your other uni counterparts. food in the dover campus isn’t so great and there aren’t many comfortable and air-conditioned study spots unless you’re able to come to schl early to chope classrooms. 

but putting all that aside, if you make good and lasting friendships, join ccas of your interest and can juggle your grades (if that’s a concern for you), your own personal life and ccas, i’m sure you’ll have the time of your life here. 

welcome to sit! :) genuinely hope you enjoy your 4 years here."
alpacapillow0,1,You might be able to experience life at the new punggol campus too!!!
Moogetsuu,2,Is the window for that open yet? I'm starting my year 1 this sept & kind of lost too since there's no guide for this.

obliviate_x,1,Hey I might be getting one too. I asked our programme leader and she did mention that windows is recommended. I managed to ask ACC SMC’s president and he said it wouldn’t be an issue cause there are people who use mac in acc.

In_His_Time,1,"Hello there, senior here.

Mind sharing on the specifics of your course? I'm from SIE Land, and I use both a laptop and an iPad for schoolwork. Reason being I need the laptop for reports and certain programs that an iPad or tablet can't. Eg, AutoCAD, Photoshop, CREO.

For the iPad, it's more of my notebook on which I take down lecture notes, do tutorials, and revise on. 

My advise for engineering that it will help you greatly. Reason being that you'll be drawing alot of diagrams, be it FBD, graphs, diagrams, etc. An iPad provides you with unlimited space and many colours to choose from. Also you can copy and paste stuff. 

You can also annotate pictures that you take."

reveanor,5,"everyone is within their rights to appeal. however, for successful appeals, i believe priority would go to those who've attended interviews (but was no offered a place). i think it should be the same across all universities."

kaleidostar11,1,"Some guys that pmed me to clarify on things had told me that appealing is still possible for those who weren't shortlisted for any courses. They emailed SIT and got a response to upload more documents even though it was optional for some of courses, it is to help with their appeal application."
