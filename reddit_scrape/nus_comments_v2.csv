tbh, a cheaper laptop that allows you to code+decent gaming pc (rtx2060 equivalent + i5/ryzen5) is usually only a few hundred more expensive than a gaming laptop (of course, this is subject to the specs you choose)"

1.12E+11,4,"6 days into NOCSV right now :) 

My interviewees were extremely hostile, told me my answer wasn't satisfying, etc. I thought I had bungled the interview, but then the program manager for NOCSV called me in for a 2nd interview, which went a lot better, he was a lot less hostile. I think some people get hostile interviewers, some of my friends got really friendly interviewers, but they take everything into account. Good luck!"

4headittor,1,"Hi to answer qn4:

you should also consider the prerequisites of each mod. Taking CS1010 APC allows you to take CS2040C in year 1 sem 1 and CS2113 in sem 2, which is needed if you intend to apply and go for NOC in Y2S1. Understanding 2040C (and 2113?) also helps in tech interviews for summer internships which normally requires you to take those assessments in the middle of Y1S2. However, hearsay CS2040C in sem 1 under Dr Steven Halim has a much higher workload. Also, if you clear CS2113 in sem 2 means you cannot do orbital during your summer break if im not wrong.

Of course I would just recommend to clear all: CS1010, MA1511 (MA1505) and MA1508E (MA2001), which allows you to take EE2211 in Y1S1 if you are interested in ML."

According_Captain_84,61,Another great week spent doing absolutely nothing productive
According_Captain_84,6,"The email is basically a copy pasted template message that gets sent out a month or so before the end of your LOA period - My guess is that the LOA period you applied for ends in Apr/May and the system just took the date of the nearest term about to start which is ST1.
So no, you dont have to take modules during ST if you dont want to, but you have the option to do so since your LOA will be over by then.

If you want to be safe, (I'm assuming you're an undergrad) just email the ug office in your faculty to confirm your intentions of starting during AY23/24 Sem1 and not ST.

Tl;dr - You can just ignore it but you can email your fac if you want"
According_Captain_84,13,"I did 2107 quite a while back so I can't really comment on the current difficulty or format but I'll assume thats its still a CTF style thing - In general, endless googling for CTF solving techniques and reading reports was what I did to solve the assgns (Both assgns took me forever to solve, I basically used the entire weeks we were given)

As for dropping the module due to deteriorating mental health, yes you are probably right that it is too late to drop it now since the request takes like 2-3 working days usually to get processed by SoC's vice dean of undergrad studies since he's busy af. (I'm assuming that your home faculty is SoC)

But if you are determined to drop it you can try submitting an underloading request now to have evidence that you got the process started before the W grade drop cutoff. Then, get in contact with SoC's student support managers - Nicholas & Adele and discuss your issue with them, they can help advocate for you to the ug office and if you're lucky (Don't get your hopes up - the next line is basically ""best case"" wild speculation) maybe some kind of pseudo-drop can still be done where you still get a W or IC grade as if you applied for special consideration or dropped it before the cutoff period.

GL though whether you decide to power through the assgns and mod or explore your options related to dropping it."
According_Captain_84,2,"Yes, not sure if they don't count the bridging modules as a ""pre-requisite nus mod"" when it comes to S/U options or because it used to be MA1101R and 1k mods are universally able to be S/Ud regardless of having prereqs"

My portfolio and CCA records are decent. However, for my O Levels I scored a B4 for A Math and A1 for Math. Will I still be considered for Computer Science?

I've read the posts on SGExams regarding this (as well as NUS website) and from what I understand I will need to go through the ABA process or just get rejected completely. For those of you who went through the ABA process for CS could you tell me what it was like? When were you notified to go for ABA and what did you have to do for it?

My second choice would be Information Security, but I really want to go for CS.

If you do not need to do any CPU intensive tasks like simulations literally any lightweight laptop of the current generation with sufficient RAM (it may look like much but 16GB is recommended because chrome eats ram like it is water) is good. If you are doing anything that requires actual computational effort (e.g.: Computing/Design/Engineering), don't be afraid to spend a bit more than your budget because you will save a lot of time on your projects this way.

You may consider looking at tech reviews for some of the Zenbooks, Grams etc. on tech review sites. Common trap but I will just say this: Do not blindly look at performance. I would take something that is slightly weaker just to get a better screen and keyboard."

Ambitious_Ad4929,21,"Currently on exchange in Sweden where the professors are also actively encouraging us to use ChatGPT for their assignments. It was actually an initiative put forth by their student association last month. One month later and it's already being promoted by the teaching staff. We get to use them to structure surveys, craft wacky taglines for our business proposals and we're even using them in our language class to craft scenarios for translating. It makes classes hella interesting. 

If this happened in NUS, it will get chucked aside by the management faster than you can even spell AI. Student voices just don't matter here."

amey_wemy,3,"For the last question, CS/Stats are the more ""traditional degree"". Most unis have them, people know what to expect.

The less traditional degrees like bza, dsa, dse, qf, are those that not every uni has (closest is dsai in ntu), so most jd wouldn't bother specifying them, and most wouldnt be caught up with the trends. But don't worry, dsa/dse definitely falls under those data jobs. And esp tech related jobs, they'll simply just throw u a technical test/take home assessment to verify your skills"

That along with the fact that many many majors is able to pursue ""data science"" such as cs, bza, dse, qf, stats, econs, etc. Don't expect easy money.

If you want money, you can consider qf, or quantitative finance. Its also under the department of math, covering similar concepts like math, stats and cs, along with well, finance.

animemakesright,5,"Application process: just submit something that is not nonsense and you & your team should be good, assuming at least one of you is in SoC. Otherwise the chances of getting into Orbital is very low. on the point about project experience, many applicants don't have any project experience and the whole point of Orbital is to give that project experience so I would say not having any coding project before is not really an issue. 

&#x200B;

Working process: as others pointed out, it depends on your difficulty level. The lower levels - Vostok, Gemini, Apollo - can easily be completed and which level you end up in really depends on whether your advisor is lazy in scrutinising your work or not. I'd say honestly, a Vostok work can be completed within a weekend even if you have no project / coding experience. As for Artemis, it is definitely a lot harder to complete at that level since your project will be graded strictly and if you look at the past few years, the number of Artemis teams by the end of Orbital have just been going down (notice how it says *complete*. at the start there will be a lot of Artemis teams but many will drop while some lower level teams might upgrade to Artemis level).

&#x200B;

sauce: my team was in Artemis level and I was an advisor last summer for Artemis teams. fyi i'm one of the advisors who actually care enough to mark projects properly and make myself available to teams for consultations so no free lunch from me... but I do know of other advisors who put in minimal work so ymmv

&#x200B;

p.s. saw a comment on faking the 160hrs. we track it based on what the team provides and yes, you can probably can get away with it if it looks legit / believable enough. but if it is very obvious then you better hope your advisor is willing to turn a blind eye..."

If you want a good grade, you'll have to put in the effort..."
ankaraskies,28,"If you have the time, read the book Die With Zero. It changed my perspective on life, money, and careers. 

I too was (and still find myself occasionally) caught up with the idea of getting a super well-paying job and earning a crazy salary. Nothing wrong with these goals - to each his own and it makes sense wanting to achieve these in a capitalistic society.

What is dangerous, however, is earning and earning and optimising for money while forgetting that the whole point of earning money is to be able to spend it on experiences that make your life what it is. 

When you look back at your life, not even just on your deathbed, but at many points, the richness of the experiences you‚Äôve had will determine your judgement of how full of a life you‚Äôve had.

This is NOT to say don‚Äôt work hard or don‚Äôt join computer science. I have a scholarship and still put effort into school, but I consciously make sure to carve out time to pursue things that make me happy. What that means is with limited time, I do not give my 100% to school (sometimes, far less lol). I make sure that I have time to pursue my other hobbies and ventures that, as a result of passion, are actually profitable too. That can be you too with your music dream and machinist dream. 

The path is not at all rosy whichever decision you make. I don‚Äôt think there‚Äôs a wrong decision. You just make a decision on how you want to allocate your time and live with it. 

Just remember one thing: Without deliberate planning on how you want to spend your years, you‚Äôre bound to coast on autopilot. You‚Äôll hit certain milestones you want in life but probably without having the kind of journey you would‚Äôve actively chosen for yourself. 

All the best :)"

If you want raw numbers in terms of financial advantage then you should look at NUS graduate salary reports but you may want to take it with a pinch of salt. However if investment banking/private equity was the best end result of a business degree then both routes are viable you know what I mean, although I tend to see more people with BBAs go into IB. Instead I think you should approach choosing your degree with an end goal in mind I.e. What career do I want to pursue? What skills do I need?

Subjects like Literature, History, and GP at the A levels will be way more useful in preparing you for an arts degree.

Also, there's nothing wrong with the ""lousier"" JCs, so for that to be your reason to go to poly is a little silly."

asdf_t,18,"Every group project between strangers is a game of chicken, whoever speaks up first will be the unofficial leader of the group - responsible for arranging meetings, setting deadlines and chasing after dead weight :-). Not much advice really, either play the game til someone else loses, do the project with friends or leader up.

IMO having been the de facto leader on most of my group projects, it does give you a lot of benefits. You can schedule timings, determine who does what and can tailor the project to your ""vision"". Most importantly for me, is that I can force the team to start the project ASAP and end up having something submit-able days or weeks before the deadline. It's a nice feeling when, up til the deadline, the only work left is to polish an already finished product."
asdf_t,34,"Are you doing the class alone? You are severely disadvantaged if you're doing the class alone, as the unfortunate fact is that there is a lot of *co-operation* going on in the cohort.

Usually the problems will be related to what is taught in class, but they sometimes do go ""out-of-scope"" and require some creativity or attention to detail to be able to Google your way to a solution. Obviously I can't give any specific help, however I can try to give some tips/stuff to look out for (Disclaimer: am not a TA and never have been one):

* Encryption & hashing
	* Note that the XOR operation is commutative and associative
	* Check the size of any generated key, if it's like 4-5 characters long, it's bruteforceable
	* Check how any RNG is seeded and see if what you see on the server can be reproduced on your end
	* The usually taught AES-ECB/CBC/CTR all have vulnerabilities
	* Basic DHKE is susceptible to man-in-the-middle attacks
	* Textbook RSA is vulnerable
	* Consider hash length extension attacks

* SQL Injection
	* This requires some luck/observational skill to figure out the query behind-the-scenes. Start with `';--` and `UNION` attacks and see what you can find

* C programming
	* You'll probably need to use `gdb`, consider learning `gdb-peda` in particular as it has some nice QoL
	* Note any casts from a signed integer to unsigned integer e.g. via function parameters
	* Check for incorrect bounds checks on user input
	* Check for any off-by-one errors (e.g. something like `for (int i = 0; i <= n; ++i) {...`
	* Check for unterminated buffers that let you write outside of allocated memory
	* If a program makes a call to `system(...)`, that's usually a plausible attack vector
	* Use `objdump -d <BINARY>` to inspect assembly code, note that the addresses of functions may not be the same on every run, and may not be the same on the server
	* When debugging a program, be sure to inspect the values of certain registers (e.g. `%rip`, `%rsp`, etc) and learn what they represent, and see if they correspond to anything worthwhile
	
* General skills
	* Sometimes bruteforcing is the solution, but usually it must be done in a smart (i.e. not naive) way
	* Sometimes the solutions don't require actual scripting or any security-specific domain knowledge at all
	* If your question involves some website on your browser, look at the browser devtools, any discernible patterns in the url, etc
	* All attacks you're expected to do can be coded yourself, but sometimes it's better to just use a tool someone else wrote"

askEScholars,10,"Hello there! Thanks for the questions. We've compiled the answers below, hope this helps :)

>Qn1:  Do I get to choose between E-Scholars and Merit Scholarship if im doing CEG. Lets say I get into E-Scholars can I not choose it but get the Merit Scholarship?

A: The student has to submit an application for NUS Merit scholarship and secure that scholarship offer. He/she will then be able to choose between either E-Scholars Scholarship or NUS Merit scholarship. ¬†

>Qn 2: What is the work load of NUS E-Scholars like compared to lets say 4H2s in A levels

A: This answer is coming from a Year 3 Computer Engineering E-Scholar. I would say that the work load as a CEG E-Scholar can be comparable to taking 4H2s in A levels, sometimes more and sometimes less, depending on which semester you are in and what modules you are taking. For instance, I personally took modules that are more intensive in Year 2 Sem 1 and found that to be more stressful of a semester (and I would say the intensity was greater than studying for A levels during that semester), but in maybe Year 1 Sem 1 it was a lot more chill compared to A levels. It differs from person to person and semester to semester.

(Another CEG E-Scholar: Overloading can result in much higher workload than 4 H2s in one sem, in his/her opinion!)

>Qn 3: Do you find E-scholars manageable

A: Definitely! While the academic workload can sometimes take up a lot of time during the semester, most of us can still find time during the semester to pursue our own interests - be it joining hackathons, participating in interest groups or CCAs. Ultimately, it's about how you plan and manage your time.

>Qn 4: What are the APCs that you suggest studying for CEG. (I know NUS gave a list of suggested APC, but which one should I prioritise)

A: It's hard to pinpoint one APC in particular to prioritize for, but clearing your CS1010 APC might be the most helpful, because regardless if you clear it, you are solidifying your programming skills in the process which will come a long way in helping you do well in CEG/any programming tasks that comes your way.

(Another CEG E-Scholar: MA1508E APT is pretty important too)

>Qn5: What kind of students are they looking for?

A: We are looking for students who are passionate in Engineering and who can show that they are genuinely interested in the engineering major that they are applying for. Being able to showcase holistic development would help too!

baka_no_sekai,1,"hihi i wasnt from poly so cant rly answer the poly related part of ur qn, but regarding the A level thing for dsa intro mod (DSA1101), i suggest writing in to ask if its possible to take MA1301 to satisfy the A level requirement  Reason being, other modules that have similar A level math prerequisite (e.g. QF1100, CS1231) also allow for this module to be taken instead. im just not sure why nusmods doesnt reflect it this way too for DSA1101.

For the second major/minor thing, every semester before module registration starts youll be asked to do something called academic plan declaration. this is the part where you can declare your intention to take certain 2nd major and minors. of course, you still need to satisfy the major/minor requirements to get it when u graduate, and i also suggest you make sure you know how to calculate the double counting of modules correctly if there's any overlap between your major/minors. 

On top of that, in the event you want to take a restricted 2nd major/minor, you will have to apply to the respective department/faculty to be approved to read that restricted major/minor. some particular combos of 2nd major/minors are also not allowed at all; in your case i dont believe that is an issue here, but do take note if you decide to change your combination.

furthermore, regarding the allocation of modules, no, the uni will not allocate modules for 2nd majors/minors that you declare yourself. as such, it's your responsibility to ensure you are able to fulfil the modular requirements. however, you will be given some level of priority over others for modules that are within your declared 2nd major/minor during module registration. 

hope this helps!"

bakedscallop,4,I can't seem to find MA2216 on NUSMods
bakedscallop,22,"To do well at coding you will need to practise a lot. Since you have already gone through one semester of CS1010S, I assume you should be somewhat familiar with the theory. Hence, what you need to do is to consolidate your foundations. Read through the notes again, and use relevant questions on Leetcode/Kattis to hone your coding skills. Of course, relevant questions on Leetcode/Kattis for CS1010S may be hard to find, so you can DM me if you are looking for practice questions in particular areas (eg recursion, string manipulation). In addition, redo your tutorials again without looking at the answer key, and complete more PYPs.

blame_autism,19,"Computer science - understanding how technology works behind the scenes makes you feel really smart, especially when coming across the technical terms learnt in classes. Though hardly anyone would enjoy being stuck on coding assignments, I have also started to find it less frustrating in coming up with a solution and learning new things while Googling.

Linguistics - the professors are really professional and supportive, though I have only had two so far. Language is something people use all the time and it's great to spot patterns and make connections to the phenomena taught in class."

CS2030S and to some extent CS2103T are quite frustrating. I end up procrastinating, then feeling terrible that I can't get started with work, and having to rush everything last-minute doesn't feel much better either.

The workload can be quite intense, having taken 3 CS mods last sem, but I have heard from students of other majors that 3 core mods is not easy either.

Edit: also a lot of the learning has to be done on the side since courses don't necessarily teach skills useful for one's career, and it can be fairly difficult to find time or have the discipline for self-direction."
blame_autism,9,"Hi I've taken CS2030S and it's really the most frustrating module I have taken at NUS so far. I have not done very well for it, so I don't think I can help with the module's content. Contacting the professor or your TAs might be the way to go - from my experience the instructors are definitely willing to help someone in need.

I would also say that doing well for this one module is not the be all and end all, since I would suppose many other opportunities likely do not require a high degree of proficiency in object-oriented or functional programming. Haivng a positive mindset and trying to make the process of learning more enjoyable seems to do the trick for me."

bluecheeseplate,56,"Grad here. Very important, that stuff can have compounding power. Especially if academia isn't your strong suit or if your course of study involves hands-on or practical work.

To illustrate: Y1 or so, you may not be able to clinch an internship at a world class company. But if you get even the slightest bit of experience at an SME, you can use that to pad your resume and net yourself a better internship offer in Y2. Rinse and repeat.

Internships are also useful for employees to sieve out those who a) have initiative or passions, and b) already have prior exp in the field, so they're not onboarding a complete newbie.

Edit: Not saying you should drop all your summer plans in Y1 to intern, but try to aim for 2 or 3 over the next 4 years. 3 was the average number of internships a student has in my course a year ago, it might go even higher as jobs get more competitive."

bobatea__,11,"ohman what a set of things to think about at 3am. well to answer one thing - why NUS CCAs require money; tbvh that's the school.... my own CCA is not funded by NUS and as a result, we have to get money from elsewhere. we're all fighting for survival. quite a shitty situation honestly :') 

to go on, i feel for you, where you say you fail to find friends who are close, i mean i understand. i'm in my third year, and it's only because i have a CCA, with seniors, with caring friends that i have a close group of friends. beyond that, my friends from my faculty and classes, they're good people don't get me wrong, but not all of them are close friends. this is because, we're often so busy with studying, or chasing the ideal CAP, unless we study together and spend time having conversations that go deeper about our personal lives, close friends aren't possible. if the people around you don't do that, then it's rather tough, and uni doesn't create much opportunity for that. the people and yourself, well everyone needs to be willing to do that, and that's not guaranteed.

good luck OP! it's not the easiest, moreover... we had two years of COVID and all. :')"

Wanted to ask about my realistic chances of securing an internship (or full-time) esp in MTI/MAS/MOF. Not sure if they filter out non-FCHs, I have a high 2nd upper. Any general tips are greatly appreciated TIA!!"

BreathOfTheOffice,2,"I used to TA this mod a few years ago, when this was still the project and not the labs. I would say that if you have a decent TA, ask them for help. Most of them have done the tasks before, and have an idea of how they would build it. Ask them for how this, and the logic flow behind why they would build it the way they do. I basically gave all of this to my students the week of the project announcement, although there were a few things that I felt was better for them to discover and figure out on their own. Would still have helped any with more in-depth info if they needed it."

Bryce3D,4,"I did Orbital (Apollo) last summer as a y1 CS student with no SWE experience. I'm personally not good at SWE and had no prior experience but was able to stay on track with my partner's help.

When you apply, make sure that your project is something that is complex enough that each of you spending 160 hours on it seems reasonable, since you have to track the time you spend and that is the minimum. The application is just you and your partner's info, your project idea, and other qualifications you can add in to further prove you can handle it iirc.

I think the most important part for a successful Orbital project is consistency. You have 2 to 3 months to work on the project. Just doing 3 hours a day is already more than enough to hit the 160 hr threshold, and you'd be surprised by how much you can do in that time. You'll also make a rough timeline of when each feature will be implemented. Do tour best to follow that schedule and you should finish successfully.

My SEA 3 mths VN friends most did SWE, BD, UI/UX, BLK71 Programmes intern etc. Generally business and tech roles are available. 

Quality of internships is a hit or miss.

byechemistry,10,"Hi there, this sounded like me 2 years ago, when I was burnout, didn't really do well in my major and just hated the industry where most of my peers were heading to (goes against my values and just toxic to me). I spent the bulk of my time just exploring what I wanted to do, and tried my hands on many things through hackathons, competitions, using UEs to explore, online courses, projects, internships etc. Of course it took up a lot of time and my studies & social life suffered quite a bit but I eventually realised what I didn't mind doing. Strongly encourage you to start exploring paths outside your major."
byechemistry,11,"Depends on the country you are going?

My pay from my internship company is actually peanuts (200SGD because I was in SEA) and wasn't enough to cover all my expenses (grocery, food, transport, rent) so the topups from NUS really helped a lot in helping me cover the cost. I spent close to $4k estimated in my 3 mths there (maybe about $3k if minus my travellung expenses) and since each month I receive about 1.3k SGD after the top ups, I'd say it was enough to cover my costs!

But definitely have heard different things from my peers who went to North America! From what I know, many of them asked for a pay raise in the middle of their internships (and many got it)."

byechemistry,6,"Almost everyone I knew who went for NOC interview were all grilled hard by the interviewers. I thought I did badly also but eventually I got in still. Rest assurred that grilling is part of the interview process and they are mostly testing to see how you react and how you can fit into the NOC programme. Nothing much you can do after the interview to be honest but if you'd to apply for it again, my advice is:
- Understand your motivations for applying for NOC. Really ask yourself WHY. Be specific on your WHY. Generic answers like ""I'm interested in entrepreneurship"" won't be enough. Show how you are interested in it and be specific.
- Start-up internship experience. Really helps to intern at a start-up
- Research on the locations you are interested to go. Find out more about the start-up ecosystem in that location and industries & job functions of your interests. For example, Silicon Valley is usually catered to people interested in tech roles and VC roles. 
- Stay calm! :) If they grill you, pause and think for a short while before speaking again."

CapitalAd1020,3,"Exam type: Varies depending on the module. See LSM module repository for more information.

Ability to do well: Depends, since everything is graded on a curve. 

Subjects that are important: Do you mean pre-univeristy subjects or LSM courses that you should have a good mastery of? 

Pre-uni biology definitely  gives you a good head start, but it's  not everything. 

LSM courses that I find most useful: Foundational level 1 modules and UROPS. Hands-on research  experience gives the most exposure and helps you internalise learnt content. 

Hope this helps! Cheers."
CapitalAd1020,1,"I think all majors are challenging in different ways. The key is to know what your strengths are and do your best. To be honest, opportunities  would always be there for students who perform well. So, for the first two years, that should be your end goal. Get as many internship opportunities  as possible  to stand out in the job market.

There are also high paying  jobs that are open to all majors. Thus, you are not really restricted by your major.  This includes consulting/banking roles if you are able to demonstrate analytical skills. Leverage on diversity  factor during these interviews. In fact, they do have non-finance quota for some firms. Nonetheless,given that these roles are ""free for all,"" you will need good grades as a diversity applicant. Thus, circling back to my point about choosing a major you can do well in. 

Hope this helps! The world is your oyster, and you are more than your degree."

Obviously, UIUC is much more well regarded by US tech companies. In fact, most US tech companies prefer hire graduates from US universities compared to foreign grads, as it is troublesome to hire foreign grads due to strict US employment visa regulations (H1B, H1B1, etc).

Computer Engineering is one of the most rigorous majors in UIUC College of Engineering, as the students have to take core courses from both EE and CS in freshman and sophomore years. In junior and senior years, students can take either CE or CS courses depending on their interests in hardware/software areas."

clyvey_c,41,"Shit's pretty tough for us cs kids right now. Most of the huge tech firms are cutting back on hiring, so overall internship availability has dropped. 

Here is my suggestion: go for SME openings and government related openings (not necessarily govtech, there are other organisations like IHIS which focuses on health care). While you may think the work experience at those places are bad, and that the pay is much lower than MNEs, but I think they are all pretty good opportunities to explore niches other than being the generic ""full stack SWE working in a big tech company"". When I say niche, I don't just mean roles different from SWE. I also mean working in industries other than the tech industry, like healthcare and finance. The skillset of cs students are needed almost everywhere, and exploring those fields now simply allows you to make a more informed choice in the future when you decide where you want to work.

Now some of you may argue that these are just copies that I huff to make myself feel better since I haven't secured an internship either, which is not entirely wrong. I however would like to see this as me trying to offer everyone an egg in this trying time.

ATB for your internship hunting!"

Most of us are overqualified."
colddeadplacee,15,"Hi! Senior here. There are 2 ways you can go about doing this:
1) Contact academic affairs. You might have to end up taking a leave of absence depending on how much you are going to miss.
2) Contact each of your profs. If they all give you permission to skip class and assignments or make up your grade somehow, you can do so too.

I missed a week of sch last sem and all my profs were supportive and nice about it."

colouredfilms,10,"i took pls8001 last sem and found it very useful. each seminar we will be introduced to some skills such as negotiation strategies and conflict resolution through role-playing activities within small groups (usually 5-6 people). not sure if this form of content delivery is for you, but i enjoyed learning about the different techniques because there were so many aspects i didn't know about collaboration (BATNA, active listening, win-win situations) beforehand. 

what helped the experience was also my tutorial group. i found the discussions active and spontaneous. just a thought, maybe it is exactly because it is cs/cu, so we engaged with the activities in a more genuine manner without fearing making mistakes. it is important to have group activities so you can discuss with fellow classmates about these skills. i don't think there will be multiple opportunities to think and discuss about topics like negotiation elsewhere in school. the prof (dr al au) also keeps emphasising on the importance of communication within groups, a soft skill that you need in collaboration.

of course such skills take time to be polished and cannot be fully mastered in 3 sessions. but with the theories that you are introduced to, it is a good starting point to think about how you want to incorporate the techniques into relevant situations. 

lastly if you wish to have 1-1 training, perhaps email the cfg staff of your faculty or the coordinators of the PLS mods to ask if they are willing to help you with that."

Commander_Durian,5,"That's how life works. You expect that when you start working, your coworkers will be super eager and everyone would contribute equally as if by some fairness axiom? People do not like to work until they have to, you'll have to chase down slackers and put them on task, so treat this as an awesome opportunity to practice these sort of situations, because that's what will be happening a lot later in life, and this experience will give you something to talk to your interviewers about when you are applying for jobs (many ask ""leadership"" questions )

P.S. If there is a problematic groupmate who is completely uncooperative though, do tell the prof asap - it will be too late once the project is almost done or done."
Commander_Durian,1,"1. It's just a menial job. You do what you're told. I don't know how do you expect a degree to come out of it (let alone a PhD which essentially requires producing high quality original research at the frontier). It's like expecting to become an Iron Chef after waiting tables in a restaurant. In fact, many PhD's are earned without the candidate ever holding an RA position (they could be TA all the way or just have a very grant-rich advisor). If you want a graduate degree, you apply for one, and then after you are accepted, they'd hook you up with some job to pay off your scholarship, which may be RA or a mix of TA and RA.

2. The pay varies by project. Usually nothing spectacular - read the particular posting for details. Some pay hourly, and some are more like salary. Do not expect bonuses.

3. The future career is whatever you make it. RA is just a temp job to tide you over the initial joblessness, an opportunity to earn some experience and make some connections. After that, it's either grad school or a more steady job  - most RA positions won't employ you for more than 1-2 years."

1. am i allowed to downgrade a primary major to a second major/ minor and upgrade my second major to a primary major in chs?
2. am i allowed to switch primary majors within the same faculty before 5th sem after declaring a primary major at admission?
3. let's say i have a complete change of heart somewhere down the line; am i allowed to switch majors from one faculty to another (i.e FASS to FOS) even after declaring a primary major?

This then spiralled to not being able to apply for housing in the first round since I wasn't technically accepted. I just think a lot of this stuff should be done a LOT earlier to avoid pointless clashes like this. If there are a specified number of spots in courses for exchangers during their first round I don't understand why they can't make it earlier. I mean finding out about housing like 2 weeks before you leave is quite stressful and from other exchange students I talked to seemed way too common.

Its probably not easy to catch you out if you dress like a student and go to lectures with big class size, but practically i would recommend googling for courses online as you wont get access to the slides and notes if you crash classes in NUS. MIT OCW has an amazing selection of courses; so do Khan Academy (tho less geared towards uni) and various smaller youtube channels."

DiegoIsReal,3,"Adding some from what I learned so far, but this is coming from an undergraduate student so take it with a grain of salt since your situation might be a bit different

1. You need to understand that companies have a limit on how many Work Pass (E-Pass etc) they can give to foreigners. Looking from the company‚Äôs POV, they may choose to allocate those pass to experienced hire compared to fresh graduate since both use the same quota. Other has mentioned how you need to convince the company to use the quota on you. Moreover, you have the layoffs that happened combined with the recession that made companies decrease their headcount. However, this second point may not apply to your case in ~2 years time and since you mentioned you have relevant experience you may be able to convince the companies more easily but my advice is just keep this in mind.

2. Sorry I am not sure about this but afaik I have never heard of such cases. You might want to ask on r/singapore since r/nus is mostly undergraduate students.

3. I guess personality wise, each company‚Äôs culture will be different. You‚Äôll need to ask the people who work on your selected company or attend career fair and ask them about it (nus just held a career fair this month and probably will in the future). Technical qualities will be different for each role but I would argue that generally programming skills would be an advantage. I think it is better you search on existing job descriptions for the roles you are aiming for."

edit: to add, i don‚Äôt think our mental health challenges will be reflected on our transcript (similar to how our health challenges won‚Äôt). i have had friends in NUS who were diagnosed with bipolar, depression while in NUS and they graduated just fine. (that was back in 2010, when mental health was even less talked about). im sure things are even better now. for one, i think the counselling centre probably has better events now. i returned as a grad student sometime in the mid 2010-2020s, and remembered taking part in some of the centre‚Äôs activities (eg mindfulness, art therapy etc.) i think they were useful in helping me cope with the stressors of studying and working at the same time. 

honestly, i think schs do care for students more than we give them credit for. if there is any reporting elsewhere, i think it‚Äôs usually if a person is in imminent harm to themselves or others, and need help quite immediately. don‚Äôt wait until then before you seek help, do go speak to someone early.

Despite being in one of the hardest courses to enter, I‚Äôm a dumb CS student, so my salary is a thousand below the median. But at this point, I don‚Äôt care anymore.

The reason why there‚Äôs high pay in CS is 1) high demand and 2) many tech companies having trouble retaining talent. Meta had one of the highest pay, but they have trouble keeping talent. And now, look at the layoffs due to its ridiculously bloated workforce.

Crypto also has high pay, but given the volatile state of cryptocurrency, it‚Äôs a high risk, high reward game.

That said, the learning structure is so painful where u click and scroll through pages of words and some sections don‚Äôt show up until u complete the in page quiz correctly, similar to 1003. I‚Äôm tempted to skip to just directly do the quizzes and reflection but some of the things required reading and following the content, otherwise u could just use logic and guess intuitively

The biggest challenge will be working on the group project - which in my opinion, and with experience with tanking projects, will be near-impossible to carry the entire team because you have to basically write an entire story with figures and etc. (I mean it's probably possible but it's probably gonna suck big time).

&#x200B;

Workload:

1. (Individual) Reflective Learning Assignment Parts 1&2 & (Individual) Online Quizzes (2x a week) (60% weightage)
2. (Group) E-Book Project (40% weightage)

&#x200B;

Pros:

1. No attendance taken (There are in-class surveys opened during the lecture time, but you can do it from home - just set an alarm to do it)
2. No tutorials
3. Content is easy to grasp for non-Science students (Mostly science stories, which are quite interesting to learn)
4. No pre-readings (A big plus especially if you're a FASS student hehe)
5. Weekly quizzes are open-book with two attempts (Answers can be found easily in lecture notes)

&#x200B;

Cons:

1. 8 am lectures, twice a week (The Biggest turn off legit bc I don't stay on campus)
2. No tutorials (More difficult to meet your team members to work on the project)
3. Ends his lecture with 15 minutes to spare (Everyone either leaves early or is rushing off after the lecture, so difficult to discuss)
4. 90% of the group project must be done by recess week (But the good part is that the second half of the semester is just presentations!)

Empty_Wheel_793,3,"It depends on the year you are planning to transfer into NUS. If you wish to enter NUS as a freshman, you can simply submit an application form with requirements similar to Common App. These are the elementary things you will need to prepare:

\- Academic Transcripts (IB, AP, A-Levels, American High School Diploma)

\- Standardized Examinations (SAT/ACT score reports)

\- Extra-curricular Activities

However, if you are planning to transfer into NUS from year 2 onwards, you are required to submit your current standing GPA. A well-crafted CV/portfolio is also recommended.

Your degree of choice is also an important aspect relative to your supporting academic documents. You can view the requirements for international qualifications on the NUS website.

Edit: Fulfilling minimum requirements does not guarantee a successful transfer/enrolment. The admission bar for international students tends to be higher than locals, therefore you must ensure your application stands out among prospective students.

Once I was done, the panel was stunned for 5-10 seconds. Got kind of flamed for that (""I feel like I am in a lecture""), which is fair tbh as I mistakenly treated it like a presentation rather than an interview.

My interviewers were okay, I had directly received some feedback on my performance as well during the interview, and I didn't have the chance to clarify/justify certain points they made (idk is it due to time limitation or it's just the style)

FlexibleDexible,4,jia you guys
FlexibleDexible,2,F
FlexibleDexible,5,Definitely possible. Know someone who is doing their Industrial Attachment during the weekdays and taking part time jobs in F&B to earn extra cash.
FlexibleDexible,193," To become true NUS SoC student you need to take full-time and part-time internship every semester and use every single second of your life in university to work and study.

Assuming that you start from year 1 to year 4, it means that you can do 8 semesters of part-time internship or 7 semesters of part-time internship with 1 full-time ATAP. If you willing to take LOA for a full-time internship is even better since a lot of companies love that cheap and sweet labors called uni students, pay lesser in the name of ""industrial exposure"" while at the same time can give more work for the sake of ""learning"". Of course I haven't even mentioned summer internship or winter internship, with 3 summer and winter breaks combined it will give you a minimum of 8+3+3 = 14 internships (part-time+full-time).

That is, assuming that you only take 1 internship per semester. Real CS student at NUS will take 2, 3, god forsaken even 4 internships at the same time üò±üòÖüòé. How, might you ask? Note that you can do internship from 9AM-5PM everyday Singapore time, then you can juggle another 9AM-5PM American time (or 9PM-5AM SG time) to maximize the grind üëçüí™. Afterwards you can also sell yourself to a research assistant position in the weekend, take on some freelance projects at your own time and earn 10000 a month commission money with no tax obligation, hell can even take TA + personal project if you are hardworking and diligent enough üëåüëåüëå. This would mean that the maximum is around 56 internships throughout 4 years of academic year in NUS. Assuming that you do a double degree then it would be 70 internships. Assuming that each internship is with a different company of course, though it's not uncommon to work for 1 company for the whole 4 years .

To truly become successful by SoC standards you need to sell your sleep and dedicate every ounce of your free and non-free time for coding. Studying at school? üë©‚ÄçüíªFuck that shit React JS comes first. CCAs and Social life?üëØ Screw lah it's time to create some microservices.

Not only are you extending your studies by another summer or however long the programme is, you‚Äôll have to pay a huge amount of money to get worse education (let‚Äôs be real, no one would actually study properly while on summer programme), and that money and time could‚Äôve been spent on a grad trip instead.

Also if it‚Äôs an option for you, exchange is way more worth it than summer (especially since you‚Äôre paying regular nus tuition fees). You‚Äôd get to experience how studying abroad is really like, build deeper friendships, have deeper culture immersion, and more time to travel and play."

No it does not. When you apply to CHS, you are applying for the course, not the major. So I don't think it matters. When I got my acceptance letter (I declared chemistry as my major), NUS even mentioned that I can always change my major and declaring chem as my first major is not irreversible. Someone correct me if I'm wrong. Heck if you're worried, you can always declare a major and then change it once you get accepted. I know of someone who first declared Life Sci as first major but is now doing Psychology as first major instead (a lot more common as you think)"

gachaboi123,32,"Hi, I will be graduating with with a degree in chemical engineer 2nd lower and intern with 2 big MNC companies. I took a 1 year LOA for those interns btw. I secured a job with basic 4.75k during last year and I thought it was a high paying job but turns out I am around the 60 percentile according to 2022 chem eng GES survey. My guess is a lot of people are jumping to tech or bank (at least that's the case for engineering) which cause the salary to skew so much. But imo, I think 2022 GES is definitely at the higher end, in fact, a bit too high. Not just tech, but a lot of traditional engineering companies in my industry \*ahem 5k micron + OT\* had began to lay off people, slow down or even freeze their hiring. I would say just take this 2022 GES survey as a grain of salt as I speculate that there will be a stagnation or decline in next yr GES survey. 

Job is quite hard to find now as I remember sending 50 \~ 70 applications and I only got 2 \~ 3 interviews. In the end, this is the only offer I got. My take is just take whatever you have first and apply for more if you feel you are underpaid or try to explore other industry which pays better. Or else, just take this job first and jump to other companies after 1 to 2 years for higher salary."

gustavmahler23,48,"> Half of the population in Chinese

Definitely more than that though, depending on your definition of ""Chinese"". ""Chinese"" can refer to both local Singaporean Chinese (and from other lands as well, by ethnicity) and Chinese nationals (nationality). 

Given that Chinese make up the majority race, and that there is a significant bulk of Chinese nationals foreign students it is definitely a majority.


Relating to your question, at the basic level, all official matters in NUS are conducted in English, so that's the lingua franca here which is generally the same throughout Singapore.

However you would definitely observe many (mostly foreign students) speaking their native tongue with their fellow countrymen.

On the contrary, most Singaporeans will just speak English (or our local variety called Singlish) with our peers in general, even if we are conversing with people of the same ethnicity. Due to Singapore's bilingual policy, all Singaporeans receive formal education in English, and study their mother tongue as a subject in school.

Some anecdotes I have observed as a Singaporean Chinese as well, usually we converse in English with students from China even during informal interactions. Also, given the proportion of Chinese nationals in the student and teaching body, I would also observe students asking/conversing with their Prof in Chinese especially if both of them are from China.

That said, certain environments and circumstances just aren't conducive to having a conversation, so its fine if you don't really engage with anyone over there - nobody can.

Also another neat little trick for smalltalk just in case you get stuck is FORD. Family, Occupation, Recreation, Dreams. Start with family and make your way down. Everybody has those things and I think its always easy to find shared experiences that way. But once again, look out for things you find interesting about their responses and don't be afraid of just taking the conversation in that direction if there is something you want to find out more about."

Hackzx_,2,"Actually for tech jobs, it is not really your major / name of your degree etc. that matters. What matters is your ability to pass the technical assessments (e.g leetcode). 

So even if you only take a spec in business analytics and you can pass their technical interviews, there's no reason why you can't get into tech roles."
Hackzx_,4,"You can always decide in y2 after you have taken the 2k mods (e.g DAO2703, FIN2704 - maybe you enjoy ops/finance then you can consider those as your specialisation). But if you hate coding, you should probably avoid BA specialisation."
Hackzx_,4,">When is SEP? What year do students normally go for SEP?

Students go SEP in Y2S2 or Y3S1 usually

>Is SEP guaranteed for all BBA students? Will only a percentage of students be chosen to go for SEP? And if so, what is the selection process and what do they base the selection on?

Nope not guaranteed. Selection is based on your SEP composite score (mix of CAP, CCA etc.)

>Since I am interested in FIN spec, will I be able to take some of my fin spec mods during SEP?

Yes possible"
Hackzx_,6,"Hi, NUS BAC senior here!

>Is hard to get A grades since NUS BAC only has 200 students, thus bellcurve causes only the top 20+ students in each mod to get A- Also any students in NUS BAC can share how hard is it to get A- and at least B- in the course

Yes, it is not easy to get A grades. Generally only the top ~20% will get A grades. Having scores that are in the median range will get you around a B+ grade. 

You will be competing with many straight A students from jc/poly so it really depends on where you rank in your cohort. 

>Is it even possible in BAC? With the insane amount of mods can someone even map non accounting mods for exchange programme

Possible to go on exchange. Accounting students usually clear their unrestricted electives during exchange as most of the accounting modules are not mappable during exchange. 

If you're taking a 2nd specialisation/major/minor, you should try and clear them during exchange.

>I currently want to join NUS BAC cos of the prestige of NUS (as per my parents)

Don't really think there's additional ""prestige"" for NUS accountancy vs other local unis. Generally accounting firms like the big 4 hires across all local unis and there isn't any special preference for NUS accounting grads."
Hackzx_,4,"Hi! BAC senior here who took the BA specialization

>1- How did you find the course to be like?

For me, I did enjoy the specialization as I always had an interest in coding and math, but with business applications

>2- What are the job prospects and realistically speaking, with just this specialization alone, what kind of jobs can you find e.g., within the IT sector? and has anybody actually done so?

I would say it's quite rare to see someone taking only a single spec in BA. Most peeps I know took a double spec (usually Finance or Marketing + BA)

Prospects wise, it really depends on how you build your resume and skillsets. For tech jobs, your skillsets are more important than the name of your course/degree and there is a stronger emphasis on technical assessments. If you can pass the technical assessments, it doesn't really matter what is your course.

I have seen my peers go on to work in a wide range of jobs such as consulting, data scientists etc. so there isn't really a fixed career path you can take.

>3- Did your cap went down after taking this course? How did u find the workload?

This really depends from individual to individual. As usual, modules are bell-curved so it really depends.

>4- Would u recommend this specialization over the other specializations in BBA if u are interested in per say programming and analysis?

I would actually recommend to take a double specialisation, to branch out and widen your possible career options rather than choose one over the other.

>5- Did you regret taking this specialization?

Nah I didn't, I think I enjoyed it. I do think the skillsets from the BA courses (ML, SQL, R, Tableau etc.) will be useful in your job as well, especially if your role requires you to deal with data or automate stuffs.

>6- For seniors who have graduated with a BBA business analytic spec degree, how is your career life now and what do you work as?

Working in one of those management associate programs now"

Halaeon,4,"As others have said, you just seem to have stage fright. The way out would simply be to recognize that generally, nobody gives a fuck.

But before that, there are several easier methods.

1. if you wear spectacles, take them off for the presentation. Being unable to see faces clearly reduces the pressure of feeling people are looking at you

2. Stare at a fixed point while speaking. Can be the back wall of the classroom, someone's forehead, doesn't matter. Focusing on one thing helps you zone out better, which should also reduce pressure

3. If you have a vivid imagination, mentally replace your classmates with minions. Yes, the minions from Despicable Me. I generally use the one with one eye.

I think its easier to teach yourself software since the resources are readily available and easily searchable online. For hardware a lot of things like the boards and shit while you could technically source it yourself, most people wouldn't even know where to begin to look. Which is understandable since its more niche. This goes for learning pathways as well.

The new ceg under cde seems to have a lot common modules and shit which the juniors dislike. Also some of the core mods get pushed back to y3 which is a big yikes. 

Btw its more useful to compare the modules directly rather than whatever descriptions the dept give the course specs. Cuz end of the day if you end up taking the same modules it makes no diff. This was one of my mistakes pre matri when I was looking into courses."

I said ""can"" instead of ""will"" because not all internships are beneficial, there are some duds around. 

It's usually a little harder to secure most jobs upon graduation without internships but it's not impossible, you just have to make up for it in other ways that would show your skills/capabilities regardless. For example, you could have been volunteering somewhere in a key position instead. Or you prefer to spend your summer/winter breaks doing upskilling courses.

But besides these points, from an individual POV, the main value internships hold for me is that you get to figure out your likes/dislikes and have a better idea of what you want to do in the future.

HedonisticSwine,34,"If those are the reasons you want to major in math, then don't. 

Do it if and only if you like math for what it is because, yes you've heard right, uni math is fucking different from JC math. 

I love using the analogy that JC math is more like engineering math and not the unadulterated form of math. There is very little computation involved in uni math, so little that I didn't suffer any major disadvantage by not owning a GC in exams. Heck, even scientific calculator feels completely optional to me for most of the higher-level classes. That's how little computation there is for math courses so be prepared. 

So having been scoring well in the past just shows you can compute but has little to no bearing on whether you understand how certain formulas are derived. 

If you can sit for down hours to solve a problem, then maybe math might work out for you. But that said, my guess is that when you are stuck with JC math problems, you are constantly making progress by trying out different approaches. In uni math, be prepared to sit down for hours with literally zero progress (i.e. you won't even be writing anything down); for me, this can last for couple of days to weeks on one problem. 

If you prefer to be making progress and not be completely stumped, then CS would be better for you because math can be very demoralizing and soul-crushing. 

If you want an example, maybe try this simple question that you will see in the first course of math major: prove that sqrt(2) is irrational. If you have seen this before, then try: prove that there exists irrational numbers p & q such that p^q is rational.

The answers are readily available online, but try working this out on your own and see if you can go through it without external help or giving up."

So I would say if you can get into a school better than  NUS then it‚Äôs probably worth it cuz it boost your employability , or if u wanna get a job elsewhere cuz most student visa allow you to work there for a few years after your studies.

Iluvforensicscience,14,"JC was so much worse cuz of the endless amount of homework, competition, and comparison especially if you are in a class full of scholars.

Personally, I feel homework was taking too much time as I feel it's alot more productive doing them mentally in your head instead of writing it down... Esp for ""memorising"" subjects like H2 Bio, H3 Bio, H2 Chemistry, and H2 Econs, where it feels like a waste of time writing the same thing over n over again (but just adjusting it slightly accordingly to the qn). Yet, I often feel obliged to do them and do them just for the sake of doing them becuz our tutors will check them at the start of class and I don't like getting scolded by them... Whereas in Uni I have much more control over how I study and get my adequate 10hrs of sleep as compared to JC where I'm often only sleeping 7hrs as I'm always rushing to complete the HW. 

Worst was during holidays where they will give you endless piles of past year papers and expect u to do them throughout the holidays :') and the exams were always right after the holidays which mean u can't exactly just slack the entire holiday if u want to do well and am aiming for dean's list. Whereas at least there's no HW in Uni once the module is over. I learned to dislike school and public holidays too because it always mean that there will be extra HW to keep us busy and that there will be tons of make-up classes the following week b4 the official school time (have to wake up extra early) to ""catch up with the syllabus"". 

They always mark insanely strict in JC too where it's almost impossible to get an A (no one ever got an A in J1, and only <1% get A in J2 prelims) and the median grade is always D/E even tho >60% got A in Alevels simply because they want us to feel pressured and nvr be complacent throughout JC. At least in Uni, there's a bell curve and generally they aren't so stringent in marking (not so rote learning and pure memorising but more application-based). I recall in JC where our tutors would use ruler to mark our scripts to ensure we hit every single key words just to get 1/2 mark. Missing any key word =0 mark. It honestly feels kinda obsessive and doesn't serve much purpose. Then after prelims, b4 alevels they were like ""as many of u have been wondering why the answer key of the past yr papers we have given u now seem to be alot less strict, it's because we have been marking alot stricter than alevels because we want to make sure u have a strong foundation in each topic, but now u can forget about being so rigid about memorising word for word as the marking in alevels is alot more lenient than how u have been marked for the past 2 yrs."" Whereas in Uni, they r more understanding and focus more on the concept and understanding and marking is less rigid (often even give ecf). There isn't negative marking for most mods I have taken too. 

The culture in Uni feels more holistic and there's greater emphasis on mental health too whereas in JC, I feels like there's a lack of mental health awareness. In fact, the tutors always feel like they r constantly pushing us, wanting us to mug everyday. There's also a constant emphasis on grades, where many tutors will annouce in class the top few students for even quizzes and tests (creating this constant comparison and need to study hard for every quiz and test to remain as the top). I recall how my tutor even say ""Please study really hard in JC, we r just asking u to study hard for 2 yrs, it will be all worth it, once u go to Uni, u can do wtv u want, play as much as u want"". Whereas in Uni most profs ik generally always ask us to focus on learning, as it is most beneficial in the long run, and not be too concerned with grades. (Some profs would even say ""how u do in this test is not a reflection of who u r as a peeson, what matters is what u learn and takeaway from this module"")."

Anyway, I got support from OFA. I was already on financial assistance, and appealed for additional support by explaining the situation and asking if they could provide additional aid even though it was outside the normal financial aid application period. They were able to provide a second bursary that covered the fees. Not sure if appeals for the MOE tuition grant are possible, but this is what I did to get out of a terrifyingly sticky situation, so you could consider it too. The OFA staff are very helpful."
is-he-you-know,8,"> Since I will most likely land in a corporate job after I graduate, I was thinking I might as well take BBA. 

If you plan to go for a corporate job, you'll be surprised how little people's degrees actually relate to their field of work. In many thoroughly academic majors (i.e. ones that focus on the subject as an academic and intellectual pursuit rather than a tool to prepare for a professional career), you aren't learning skills or gaining knowledge that is explicitly linked to the work you do. Instead, you learn how to think and develop a level of plasticity in how you approach issues. In other words, your observation here:

> I'm not sure if I will be learning anything that is useful to my career 

... will be applicable to many majors in NUS. But you do find majors which provide training that more directly links to certain professions, e.g. computer science, data science, etc. As for life sciences: I'm a life science major and don't intend to pursue it as a career, and know of many peers who have gone on to a mix of roles that don't involve life sciences. I'm pursuing my second degree instead, which was originally meant to be a ""for-fun"" pursuit. On that note, I'd add that your passions always shine through and, while it is important to consider the future prospects your qualifications bring, where there's a will, there's a way.

I'm very much separate from the business world and don't know what the BBA course is like, so I can't give much input there.

One last note is that, whether you pursue Japanese studies or not -- but especially if you do -- please note that ""Jap"" is a slur and the appropriate abbreviation for ""Japan"" or ""Japanese"" is *Jpn*."

is-he-you-know,4,"When it comes to doctoral training, it's more relevant to consider who you want to work with rather than what university to go to. If you have at least a rough idea of the research area you want to pursue, then you should look for professors, labs, and research groups that share those interests. Sometimes your choice of university can also be constrained by different research traditions: in my field, linguistics, universities like Harvard and MIT excel at one branch (formal linguistics) while ones like Stanford and Pennsylvania are better known for another (sociolinguistics). Of course, if NUS and US universities all have people working in your area of interest, then good for you!

You should also think about your prospects beyond the PhD: you mentioned the chances of working in Singapore -- do you mean in academia or in industry? If it's academia, keep in mind that universities seem to shy away from hiring faculty who got their PhD there. If it's industry, how does the job market look right now -- especially for people in your demographic sector -- and how might it have changed by the time you get the doctorate?

Also, beyond choosing an advisor/a university, don't forget that you're also choosing a city where you'll live for the next 3 to 5 years as well as a culture and community you will be enmeshed in during that time. Cost of living, climate, language, (to some extent) politics, and physical safety are all things that need to be on your radar.

There's a lot to bear in mind and it can be overwhelming, so my advice (if I may) is to do thorough research and continue reaching out to different people who can give input, as you have done here. All the best!"

Lets say you want to map FIN1001A (hypothetical module) but no mapping exist with the PU, then you will have to submit a module mapping for approval. Rule of thumb is that the module should \~70% similar in content when compared to the NUS module in order to get approved.

* There is no way you will get it switched in time to apply for SEP slots as FASS can only deal with your SEP after you officially switch (which is earliest next semester and typically takes 1 semester of admin time)

Are there any important implications and is it reversible?

is1103_is_Trash,7,"BBA (Accounting) otherwise known as BAC and BBA are 2 separate courses.

* BBA has focus on business administration and have multiple specialisations e.g. Marketing, Finance, Entrepreneurship, Human Resource (MNO) and graduates work in a varied number of jobs in the market.

It is very hard to explain everything that is different because they are extremely different courses apart from some common modules both degrees take in the first year.  I would recommend reading the information on the NUS BIZ website.

BAC: [https://bba.nus.edu.sg/academic-programmes/bba-accountancy-programme/introduction/](https://bba.nus.edu.sg/academic-programmes/bba-accountancy-programme/introduction/)

BBA: [https://bba.nus.edu.sg/academic-programmes/bba-programme/introduction/](https://bba.nus.edu.sg/academic-programmes/bba-programme/introduction/)

is1103_is_Trash,8,"I cant answer for all question but here are some that I do have the answers for:

4. Downgrade to NUS Biz (Most Important qn I need answer to)

Yes it is possible to apply to switch degree. Best case scenario is to do it in Y1 as BBA and BAC have quite a number of common modules in Y1.

However, even if you do it later, the excess BAC modules will be converted to Unrestricted electives (UEs) and count towards your degree requirements. It just means you have less UEs to do other modules which are interesting to you (e.g. Language) or to pursue a 2nd specialisation) unless you extend your term.

You can apply up to Y3S1 (5th semester) but to not extend your term you will have to complete it by Y1 latest. Something to note is that the application to switch **can be rejected**.

5. Overseas Exchange programme for BAC

While it is harder due to Charted Accountant requirements, it is possible as you can map some modules and/or UEs to exchange as well.

You can also check out this website for more information on BAC Exchange - [https://bba.nus.edu.sg/academic-programmes/bba-accountancy-programme/exchange-programme/](https://bba.nus.edu.sg/academic-programmes/bba-accountancy-programme/exchange-programme/)

6. Should I consider NTU Acc or SMU Acc instead?

Firstly, you should go to all the uni open houses and speak to the students/profs there to figure out what works for you. All 3 unis are good but have very different teaching styles and areas of focus and trade-offs.

NTU's 3 year program does have a limitation of having 1 year less for internship/exploration but it is also a benefit that you graduate earlier (again trade-offs)

&#x200B;

>*SMU has community service as a mod counted towards credit.*

NUS BAC has many modules which are not counted towards credit too so again trade-offs.

&#x200B;

>*SMU also does not feel like a full fledged Uni cos of no hall options at all limited number of faculties (smaller Uni but higher fees)*

Not everyone in NUS is guaranteed hall/RC stay so if hall is something that is important to you, NTU might fit your bill as it has guaranteed hall stay.  (again trade-offs). Facilties wise I think all unis are similar in the types of facilities available for students and size doesnt really matter."
is1103_is_Trash,1,"Additionally, to those that chose to convert ur DMP to DDG or vice versa, what were ur thoughts and how did u come to ur eventual decision? Pros and cons? What r ur thoughts in it now?

Context: I am not a LS/Psych Major so just sharing some of my experience.

Main reason is that the difference in number of modules in DMG vs DDP was only 18MCs so it didnt really make sense for me to not change it to a DDP. Usually this occurs when there is very little overlapping modules.

Having 5 years to complete also gives me more breathing space to do things such as intern and going on exchange which would have been very tough in a DMG given the 4 years timeline.

MAIN CON:

You graduate later + 1 year more of tuition fees. You got to be ok with all your friends graduating and you are still in school.

Most people have no experience in building software development projects before, so you are fine. However, those aiming for Artemis/Apollo level usually have some sort of experience. There will be peer review for your project at every milestone (every month), so make sure that your team hit the expected requirements for your indicated level, or else you may be demoted to a lower level. All project team will have an advisor so they will be the one who inform you about the deadlines, things to do, etc. Artemis level team will have an additional mentor to guide them. 

Majority will do the Apollo level. If you just want a chill and relaxing summer, can consider Vostok or Gemini. For Artemis level, people usually spend their entire summer working on the project (prepare to do your project at least 5 days a week as projects will be reviewed by advisor/mentor once or twice a week).

Jjzeng,4,"Hi there! I‚Äôm in my 4th semester at RV, i can try to answer most of your questions!

1. The college‚Äôs theme is indeed sustainability, but that does not affect the type of the students they take in. In fact, i would say a majority of the residents are from computing or biz, with a healthy number of CHS and students from other faculties

2. Sorry, I‚Äôm from computing haha

3. I wouldn‚Äôt say the insect problem is severe, tbh. In fact i think it‚Äôs improved quite a lot since my first sem. Window mosquito nets will help, but may be difficult to apply to some of the windows as some rooms have the lattice-style windows with a lever. 

4. RV is in fact in the midst of massive renovation works to install air conditioning in a large number of rooms, so i can‚Äôt tell you for sure how easy it will be as the works are slated to complete during the summer break

5. Personally I‚Äôve had a lot of fun with the RV modules, i can‚Äôt speak for the UTCP modules but i know that the RV modules are mapped 1 to 1 with the general education modules required by nus. Last semester i had a pass/fail module (sadly it will be a graded module in the next AY) which involved us going to nature reserves and photographing animals, then graded us on how many we could identify correctly

6. Honestly i couldn‚Äôt tell you, but from what I‚Äôve heard is that RV looks older (the building is old but the college is new), and it‚Äôs not inside utown. But on the contrary, older building means the rooms are much larger than the utown RCs, and RV is perhaps the most accessible RC simply because it is not in utown, most faculties are walkable from rvrc and there are a lot more bus stops and bus lines available to us. Exam venues are also very close by (just cross the road) and the medical centre is also just across the road

7. I don‚Äôt really remember much from my interview back then, but i would say they weren‚Äôt very particular about the type of the students they accept, they just want you to come in with an open mind and learn as much as you can

8. Probably not? Lmao why would it decrease your chances of being admitted?

9. Not really, idt the rc applications look at RP

10. Very quiet and nice ambience, unless your room faces the road (only 2 blocks have this issue tbh), but there are quiet air conditioned areas to study. As stated above, there are currently renovation works to install AC, but these are slated to finish before the next AY starts"

joeltan111,3,"This post is posted in the NUS reddit so i'll answer specifically for NUS BBA(Acc).
The fallback for most accounting grads is big 4 audit in fact. Its sort of the place you go if your other job applications fall through or if your resume isint that good. That is not to say its bad, just that the combination of relatively low starting pay and potentially long peak hours turns people off.
In NUS accounting, many students set themselves apart through internships and 2nd major/spec, resulting in many going into bank jobs where the pay is better. 
Yet another option is to go into industry right out of uni- join the finance department of a MNC. 
Finally, a good number do join big 4, but in other roles, such as consulting, advisory or tax."
joeltan111,1,"1. Top Students Only? (RI, HCI and IB, Merit Poly)

There'll be top students over most courses. 10 years ago, there were many top students in BAC yes. Now i think most have gone to SoC, but there'll probably still be a few.

2. The Bell Curve

Not that tough. Yes, it depends on the curve, but the NUS curve usually gives average grade of B+. Also, there are qualitative and quantitative (writing and non writing) mods. Some students are good at things like corp gov/corp law, others are good at valuation etc. The average GPA from what i know is 3.9 +-0.3, meaning that most graduate with 2nd lower or upper (now honours merit/distinction).

3. Employability for low grade grads

BAC is one of the MOST employable for low grade grads. Why? Accounting firms always need BAC students. The job might suck (low pay and long hours), but for a BAC student, the fallback is always a big 4/ worst case- mid tier audit job. There's a reason why BAC has the highest employment rate (almost 100%) consistently across the years. You can always drop your honours after 3 years and grad as a normal degree- this is worth slightly less than a NTU acc degree and is done by students who want to go straight into Big 4 audit and have offers already. A few students each year do this. But i would say that >95% of BAC students graduate with honours.

4. Downgrade to NUS Biz (Most Important qn I need answer to)

Can be done.  I know of course-mates who did this. If you do so after 2nd/3rd sem (meaning you've taken core acc mods that arent in the bizad curriculum), those will become UEs. But the basic biz mods are largely the same, so i think that if you are hesitant to move across, it can be postponed as late as Y2.

5. Overseas Exchange programme for BAC

Acc mods aren't usually mappable overseas due to SQP (CA Singapore) requirements other than a couple of mods (think managerial accounting is one). Thus, BAC students on overseas exchange (most used to go for overseas exchange) usually map across core biz modules, 2nd spec modules (very popular for biz students to do a 2nd spec in finance), or 2nd major modules.

6. Should I consider NTU Acc or SMU Acc instead?

Many have this dilemma, i did too. NTU pure Acc gives you less time yes. But it enables you to enter the workforce earlier. SMU acc and NUS acc is about the same imo if you compare the curriculum in detail, one factor as you mentioned is residential life.

Ultimately as someone who is in the job market for 3+ years, I don't regret going to NUS BAC. Careers wise, if you just intend to clear the core ACC content and big 4 accounting firm internships, you're likely gonna end up in a Big 4 audit job. If you want more than that (banks/finance etc), you need to set yourself apart through 2nd majors/spec/2nd degree or internships. Same applies for any accounting degree in Singapore- Employablity wise is about the same. NTU acc, being 3 years, usually has less time to do another major/spec or internships, which is the main reason why so many of them end up in Big 4 audit. SMU Acc grads usually have multiple internships under their belt, and often manage to do a bank internship and convert from there, which is why the starting pay is often higher.

GPA is also not representative of your salary. I have friends who had lower GPA than me, but because they interned better, landed jobs at banks, whilst i ended up at Big 4 advisory."
joeltan111,3,"Why not consider doing a part time masters? Take 2 years and do it part time with night classes/weekend classes. It wont be easy, and you'll have not much time outside of work/classes/assignments, but it's a way to both get work experience and do a masters."
joeltan111,7,"As someone who overloaded throughout, just some comments:

1. Typically i dont advise people to overload beyond 24 MC a sem- reason being that from what i see, any workload beyond that necessitates serious compromises on either your personal or academic life. Its better to maintain a consistent 24MC workload throughout
2. Added to this is your choice of academic plan- CS and Math- which are quite tough and have many very smart students. You'll face enough competition for grades, dont overload yourself more than necessary.

On to your specific plan:

1. Advise you against overloading to 32MC and 28MC in your 2nd and 3rd sems. Rather, consider taking modules in your first special sem (2030, 2040 are all available then), and do 20-24MC in final sem.
2. Consider splitting your hard mods over more semesters. For example, do 3230 and 2106 in your 4th/5th sems (need to see the prereq chain and what you specialize in)
3. From what i remember, almost all SoC modules are 4MC, so not sure where are you going to find the 2MC modules to make up a 18/22MC workload.
4. Think your math 2nd major will eat up almost all your UEs- meaning you wont need/ cant do MOOCs.
5. Not everyone does dissentiation- from what i know only those going for highest distinction do it nowadays. Most people are doing only final project and replace dissentiaton with modules. 
6. Consider having your final internship credit-bearing (6MC credit bearing summer internships dont need to pay fees, so its more worth just to do the paperwork to claim the 6MC.
7. Result: 24MC +8MC + 24MC + 24MC + 6MC + 24MC + 24MC + 6MC + 20MC = 160MC.

Bottom line- it's possible to grad in 3.5 years without overloading beyond 24MC. I did 232MC in 4 years without going beyond 24MC a sem except for my final sem."
jol0720,1,"You may want to preread your lecture notes and watch some youtube videos before you attend the lectures.

The 27 hour window is also already quite long. It‚Äôs meant to be an alternative to the much complained about first come first serve system that NTU and other universities overseas use.

juliusnguyen,3,"Hi! To add on to what the other commenter have said, I think it's also important to familiarize yourself with reading philosophical texts, as some can be excruciatingly hard to read. 

The only advice I have for you regarding reading is that you should read more and read with your peers, if possible, because often times a philosophical texts might lead to different interpretations and thus it's good to have someone to discuss it with. 

Writing-wise, I think the aspects that you should focus on are conciseness and clarity. One of my philo professors told me that if my essay can be readily understood by someone without any philosophical background, then that's a good essay. Keep in mind that this probably does not apply to all but still a pretty good indicator of whether your writing is clear or not. Conciseness-wise just try not to use unnecessary flowery expressions that do not contribute to the points you are making. 

Luckily for you, the NUS philosophy interest group is going to organize 2 workshops, one for reading, one for writing to help you hone your skills. You can sign up with the links here: [https://forms.gle/UMtzmxJyrPaFATcq9](https://forms.gle/UMtzmxJyrPaFATcq9) (reading) and [https://forms.gle/DBkK6UfqueV5X6v58](https://forms.gle/DBkK6UfqueV5X6v58) (writing).

jytkx,31,"A fellow poly grad here who entered NUS alone.

As what others have commented, it‚Äôs familiar but on a higher level. It‚Äôs a similar routine but much more info to digest. 

If you‚Äôre referring to non-academically, I can‚Äôt speak for everybody but I personally felt like a foreigner since most of the students were from jc. The first few things they ask when meeting someone new is always ‚Äúwhich jc were you from?‚Äù
Also, a lot of them are at the stage of joining new ccas, going to clubs etc, basically at a different stage of life so it can be tougher to click with them (have already gone through that in poly).

However, it does help joining orientation camps to meet new people, especially batch mates from the same course. It sucks joining a new class by yourself as everyone is pretty much in cliques already so keeping in touch with people you meet from course camps can be quite helpful. 

With that said, I was at the stage of focusing on working part-time to pay for uni so I wasn‚Äôt keen on joining ccas and will always try to keep my schedule as minimal as possible to reduce the number of days that I have to be in school. 

It could be quite different for those who stay on campus and are more keen on school activities.

The transition wasn‚Äôt easy but over time, I got used to it and managed to make a few like-minded friends. 

Anyways, if you‚Äôre entering uni soon, all the best! It can be daunting at first but do try to step out of your comfort zone and just do your best, I‚Äôm sure you‚Äôll do fine. Hope this helps."

KaiKurious,3,"Some of the questions I have:

1. What is traveling as an exchange student like? Do you fly by yourself or with people from your campus who are going to the same program? How early do you arrive in Singapore before the semester starts?
2. I heard that housing is limited at NUS, so would it be likely that I would have to rent an apartment? If I had to get an apartment, would it be difficult? and how expensive?
3. On the UCEAP website, there's an estimation on how much the program would cost, but I was wondering how much of that is accurate? for example, UCEAP says NUS for fall 2023 would cost \~$16K USD for tuition, housing, food, necessities, fees, etc.
4. I heard that a student visa in Singapore is called a Student Pass, but would I get a short-term student pass for Singapore since I'm only there for a semester? (is a short-term student pass a thing?)
5. Is there anything I should be aware of before I study abroad?"
kaiwen98,1,Yes
kaiwen98,6,"I think depends on what you want to do. Most decent software internships are all ATAP. IA would mostly be research, electrical or semicon internships. If you want to gear towards a computer science career when you graduate, you should take up an ATAP. Else if you want a hardware career, you are more likely to find something suitable in IA.

For self-source internships, I think some company just accepts your choice on whether you want to do it under ATAP or IA as long as it fits the description.


Some people find the extra 2 MC in ATAP attractive too!"

General questions:

* how do you apply to CHS without declaring your major? The [application guide](https://nus.edu.sg/oam/docs/default-source/application-guide/cat-a-application-guide.pdf) doesn't say anything about it, but I've heard it's possible.
* are merit scholarships awarded by major or faculty? E.g. if a student were applying for the scholarship & indicated their choice of a DSA major, would they be competing for the limited percentage of scholarships only with other prospective DSA majors or with every other student in SOC?

If there are any physics majors in this thread, can I ask:

* roughly how large is the cohort size? Have seen it's around 40 in a previous AMA, but that was 2 years ago so am not sure if it's changed now
* how competitive is it to be accepted into the course? Is the cohort size small because of competitiveness or simply because it's (relatively) niche?"

Kmskmskmss,1,"Hihi after doing research on the courses I‚Äôve narrowed down to geography and environmental studies at NUS and am having a huge dilemma choosing between them, but I‚Äôm attending open house next week to get more clarification. I guess here are some pointers about my situation

- I love nature and am passionate about the environment (duh), particularly in areas like sustainability, environmental law and policy, how humans interact with the environment and environmental issues. Oh and I love rocks too LOL
- Math and Chem were the bane of my existence in JC so I would like to avoid them in uni at all costs (which is why I ruled out NTU E2S2). Do I have to do math and chem in BES? Since from what I understand its an interdisciplinary course
 - I‚Äôm not keen on studying plants and animals in depth, does BES cover a lot of ecological stuff?
 - I didn‚Äôt take geog in JC but back in sec sch I enjoyed both physical and human geog (am passionate about societal and global issues too). Actually I‚Äôm more humanities inclined, so would geog suit me more instead?
 - How do the job opportunities for BES and geog differ? Apart from the obvious one like urban planning and GIS for geog. Which course presents better job prospects and earning potential? 

Thank you for taking the time to read this! There isn‚Äôt much info avail about these 2 courses so I thought I would ask for some advice here. Seniors who are enrolled in these courses feel free to advice me or anyone who is in the same situation as me please do so, would really appreciate it :))"

kweht,8,"Generally, the less academic a CCA is, the easier it is. I‚Äôm biased, but comedy club is pretty warm and welcoming if you‚Äôre into that.

Friendships, like all relationships, brew pretty slow! I didn‚Äôt make too many friends from CCAs but I understand it‚Äôs a great way to meet people. Generally, though, you have to engage people in conversations beyond the CCA formalities, so always helps to broaden your interests and develop a common ground with folks you want to befriend."
kweht,2,"Background: did both modules (albeit in the regular terms)

There is a fair amount of variance wrt faculty (and consequently workload type) but I think most people would concur on CS3244 being more intensive. (That‚Äôs not to say that CS3243 is light, given that some of the assignments were literal hell.) But the gap between the CA and the taught content is higher for 3244, whereas 3243 is implementing various search algorithms, essentially iteratively. 

Unless you have prior ML experience/knowledge, I would recommend 3243, especially if you have a good grasp on 2040 concepts. 

PS: Mahler is a great choice for a username!"
kweht,11,"Plenty of people who do badly in the CS1010 range of modules eventually do okay in the higher CS modules. (Okay doesn‚Äôt mean straight As, but you don‚Äôt struggle as much, is the point). This is not that obvious because the general performance, negative outliers aside, is quite correlated. This is due to other modules being more focused on narrower domains, more interest, experience etc. Hope this puts you somewhat at ease. 

However, the problems you raise are a little concerning and you would need to analyse the shortcomings a bit to figure out what is not working in the module for you. When your friends give you the answers, do you understand what they are doing? (Trust me, reverse engineering copied answers might be the most popular way of passing CS1010S). If not, go by the programs line by line, figure out what each component does, and see if you can virtually recite from memory what your friends are doing. Once you reach that stage, you can try to think of your own solutions. Try something like this: because you understand the components, write down your best attempt at the solution, then compare it with your friends, see why yours doesn‚Äôt work.

The other piece of advice is that, notice that your assignments and your exams are structured fundamentally differently, testing for different things. Once again, because performance is highly correlated, this is hard to notice. But if you really want to optimise for a grade, you‚Äôre better off figuring out how to do the midterms and finals right, since the assignments clearly have a way of working out, for everybody. And that means practice with problem solving, where leetcode comes in. Don‚Äôt bother moving beyond the easy category, it‚Äôll take up too much time and is at a higher level than cs1010s tests for. Do the past papers, and make sure you understand the solutions. Understanding them comes first and then you try to come up with them on your own. 

Good luck!"

LastMarzipan,9,"Since you are looking at a credit bearing interning, do think very carefully before accepting any offers as the school won't like it if you renege. Reneging an offer can cause you to fail your internship and it is something that has happened to some students.

Regarding your dilemma, I would suggest you to ask for an extension to consider the offer. If you are still in the process of interviewing for other companies, try to get other companies to expedite by saying that you have an offer on hand.

Yes, TalentConnect will populate with more listings for ATAP during the period that they ask the students to apply. However, most of those listings won't be from the 'hot' companies, mainly gov stat boards and random start ups. Most people will still self-source from LinkedIn or by directly applying to the company's career site.

Some listings may also be there for formality purposes only as all students who self-sourced internships for ATAP have to get the company to make a listing on TalentConnect. Therefore, sometimes, the listings aren't actually real job postings looking for applicants."

3. I detox(?) from school with my hobby- cooking. I‚Äôll cook at 11am-1pm if I‚Äôm feeling stressed and that‚Äôll help me relieve some stuff (+ foooooooooood!)

4. I always plan ‚Äúemergency days‚Äù where I have nothing on that day planned (except school events if any). If I‚Äôm on schedule, I‚Äôll get a day off! If not, I don‚Äôt stress and use that day as a backup date.

5. Start your projects early, as soon as the briefing is out (even if your other projects aren‚Äôt done as long as you aren‚Äôt overwhelmed). Usually I start just by brain dumping everything I want to write, and copy pasting class notes/ material into each section for my report

6. You might have a high intensity cca or commitment, you could consider going on hiatus until you get things going, I‚Äôm sure they‚Äôll understand

P.S. I like to try to do the work (e.g. the report section is about exchange rates for econs) before the actual tutorial, so I can pinpoint the important stuff and write down in my report, and also try to weave the answers out of the the tutors with specific questions. I try to stay back for 15-30 minutes while my memory is fresh to finish a draft! 

Hope this helps, because this was what helped me get through this competitive poly course. (We get about 6-7 modules a semester, with 3 projects per class due to Covid <no/ very low exams>)"

2. Use highlighter to go over the important point in the book. So the next time you read just zoom into that part. However if this mod has an open book exam or allows cheat sheet then can‚Äôt be lazy must write the notes. 

3. If it‚Äôs digital copy I‚Äôll try to use the screen reader to get it read to me. Personally I find listening to text makes me somehow understand more than just glancing through. But obviously this won‚Äôt work well for topics with a lot of formulas and code samples. 

4. Sometimes reading is boring I like to read the concept and do the example immediately. Repeat till done. (Note, not all lecture notes or course material is organized so seamlessly)

5. Btw did you know reading and writing the notes in your own words immediately has a hidden benefit? It‚Äôs kinda like a mini test of that one section. You‚Äôll actually retain more later on."

ludwigvankitteh,2,"As i understand, (correct me if i am wrong) there is no ""post graduate work visa"" equivalent (such as that in NZ and AU) in SG.

Graduating from a degree programme in SG does not give u a ""right to work"" visa. Its still contingent on the hiring company's ability to obtain a work pass for the foreign hire, subject to the usual quotas.

Given the tight labour market, dont expect to be able to find jobs easily after graduation. Locals are more than likely being prioritized.

TLDR: Graduating from a programme in SG does not guarantee you a visa with the right to work here. You need the employer to go through the same standard process of hiring a foreigner. Locals likely being prioritized in tight labour market."

I recommend you check out the kinds of things math majors actually do first before considering the degree.

Mappy39,-1,"As someone who took CS1010E 3 sems ago, I can safely tell you there is a bell curve. That explains why one could flunk PE (eg. Score around 40-50/100 for it) and still get a decent grade overall simply because the 75th percentile for that particular PE was 40/100."
Mappy39,26,"Nope, but the Professors/TAs may touch on certain concepts or give out certain hints during tutorials which may be instrumental to one's understanding/for upcoming tests and exams."
Mappy39,1,Its manageable as long as you don't panic
Mappy39,6,"1) You can apply once you have taken at least 60MCs worth of modules, with at least 16-20MCs worth of modules contributing to the second degree you are interested in. That means the earliest you can send in your application is Year 2 Sem 1. Further information can be found on NUS website on the requirements (eg. Minimum GPA etc)

2) There are no consequences, apart from the fact that you will not be allowed to apply for DDP ever again until you graduate.

3) Yes that is correct. If your faculty for the second degree requires the fulfilment of certain modules (eg. FAS1101, exposure modules etc for FASS students in CHS) you will need to clear them before you can graduate. And yes it is possible to delay them by dropping the modules."
Mappy39,13,"If you are struggling, then the cohort in general is also struggling too on average. Don't give up and try your best to understand the concepts/math taught in the various chapters covered as snippets of them may be seen in higher level modules (eg. EC2101/EC2102) in future if you have to take them. However, I would say your performance in this module is not indicative of how you may fare for higher level modules, so don't worry too much about it.

I believe in the first lecture, the Prof would have said that this module is outright a math module. In other words, practice and consistency makes perfect. It is completely fine to be slightly unsure of the concepts covered at first, but overtime with repeated practice things should become clearer.

For the record, I found it how amazing my tutorial mates in tutorials could ""complete the tutorials with ease"" while I maintained a ""surprised pikachu.jpg"" expression as I was kinda lost. However, that didn't matter much because they too also struggled in midterms, and also finals to some extent. I remembered differentiating y = e^x wrongly in the exam (which was essentially 50% of the midterms) and I still managed to do satisfactorily well for the exam, and module overall (Prof Kong is nice and gives method marks if your thought process/working is correct despite wrong answers, likewise for subsequent parts that involve using answers from previous parts).

All the best!"

before the second offer i had asked for the contract bc it has been months and they havent made me sign anything but hr told me to wait. i waited until another company reached out to me and i eventually went with the second offer and bc that was better aligned w my career goals and bc i havent signed anything with the stat board. if the stat board had made me sign the contract earlier i wouldve no choice but to reject the second offer but they didnt. i then told hr that i wasnt able to proceed with the internship and got scolded over email - i definitely burned bridges here. 

eventually it boils down to which offer are u more interested in and if its the second offer, are u willing to burn bridges with the stat board in order to take up the second offer.

If you are not gonna do anything heavy, Asus Zenbook is a pretty popular choice among students. If you're feeling a little basic you can even try MacBook lol. But you will have to get used to using a Mac since it's alot different from Windows.

Also, an important tip is to check out the specifications of each laptops, not just the brands. Even within a brand, the company can still cater to different types of customers with their different series. Make sure the specifications meets your needs along with the budget."

Toughest part was trying to be on level ground in terms of academic strength alongside the JC peeps. Or maybe it is some perceived difference between poly and JC that made me feel kinda inferior in some way. Though, you will come to find that academic background matters less as you go on further. lecturers may refer to A level knowledge as a ""you have done this before"" kinda thing directed at the JC peeps so you might feel neglected at times.

Seeing half-empty lecture halls after week 1 does bring back good memories tho; Some things just don't change I guess haha. And I will  admit that I do miss working with my poly coursemates since I kinda find JC peeps take some time to get flexible when it comes to group work.

Social life is relatively identical to poly. Tbh, it's kinda nostalgic looking at the JC peeps exploring their newfound freedom knowing we had our turn during our poly days. 

Tough at the start, but gradually gets better (if you put in the effort) is how I would describe the transition."

All we had to do was reach out to our friends.

Does it get better when you start working? No it doesn't if you're gonna compare with others. More friends/acquiantances are gonna get attached, that's the truth.  

But maybe it would get better for yourself if you get into the right company, right department, right team, preferably fresh grads.  

I suspect my work partner is like you. Not many friends before working. Don't really hear him talking about going out w friends whatsoever. But i guess he's better now since my colleagues and I would hang out together, sometimes even outside work.  

Anyway, it's never too late to find your own group of friends. I personally believe to start with yourself. What do you want to do with life? Have a hobby? Start a business? Once you find your own thing, it's easier to find like-minded people or have something to say about yourself. It makes you more interesting. Hopefully you find peace with this issue as I did."
MyOwnFaithlessness,8,"I liked how this professor is cognizant that students would tinker with AI and use it eventually without prompt. Addressing that white elephant early (and earnestly!) allows the professor to make what would have been a tool for ""dishonesty"" be a chance for positive learning experiences to emerge from its' use instead (such as growing proficiency in the use of AI). 

And he gets to keep the class grounded by his rules. Big win in my book."

myuktea,9,"hello, I'm currently in my 2nd semester at RV

Q1) The programme being centred around sustainability means that the modules taken at rv (to substitute some chs mods) will be related to sustainability in some ways. Even if your major is not about environment, as long as you manage to cinch the interview you'll be able to get in. Of course, if you are in a related major, you can use it as a reason to apply(?)

Q2) I'm not extremely active in activities since I'm quite introverted, but it's enjoyable if you make friends that click with you

Q3) About insects: I live quite high up for RV, but there will be occasional sightings of insects especially due to rainy season. But they don't crawl/fly into my room unless all my lights are on and windows are open. A friend staying near the forest has more insects though, so they use mosquito nets. Of course, if you meet any creepy crawlies, just yell for help or something, message the level/house chat and someone will come to help

Q4) I've never asked anyone about how they got portable air con so I can't answer this haha personally I think dont need air con because the fan is pretty strong even at medium speed. air con room is hard to get because only 1 block has limited rooms

Q5) idk about UTCP mods either cause I didn't check those out. RVRC mods would be like any other mods I would assume, and heavily reliant on writing, no finals. Just that now the communities and engagement(?) mod is no longer cs/cu.

Q6) idk why rvrc is not popular. There's an entire sheltered walkway to the exam halls which is godsend during the current rainy season + its 5 min walk away from all my lectures at science. Only con is that YIH is now closed and you cant grab food from there anymore. In comparison, perk of UTown is its liveliness and food I think? I also like the park and chalet vibes of rv (When I was applying I was also wondering why people didn't like rv. seems to be because of the old curriculum and bugs)

Q7) I can't answer because I don't know. Environment and sustainability lovers?

Q8) You have to be an NUS student to stay in RC, I dont understand what your question means

Q9) No, considering how people in RCs are all from different majors and faculties. As long as you in nus and you apply, you have a chance of getting in. 

Q10) there's works going on for air con building but so far it does not affect me. Its only during the day. affected blocks have the option of going to other places in the rc to study (like places will be opened up+there are many study lounges) Walls are thin like any other hostel so it largely depends on your neighbours noise level

Good luck with your application!"

Tho as a year 1 if you are talented enough to be able to secure an internship offer, then by all means you can go ahead and void your confirmation for cvwo to give others a chance. just do not go 180 after you confirmed your participation in cvwo, it will definitely look bad on you, especially if you were to take a mod under the prof in charge in the future (hint: cs2109s is a core mod)."

nightwind0332,12,"Rip I actually forgot the reason even though I asked the people in charge why, years ago. What I can add however is that this has been the case since around 2002 back when the whole network was different. Kent Ridge MRT wasn't a thing, A1 and A2 terminated at PGP (this was the case until 2021), and most people entered and left campus via CLB/IT. The stop was not called Museum back then, but rather Office of Estate Development (the office shifted to Ventus in 2014 and the stops were renamed then).

Ironically, what I do remember of the reason why OED was part of A2 instead of A1 was related to serving Engineering rather than the OED itself. I guess they had assessed that there was more need for the E3 area to have a connection towards Science rather than the other way round."

However here are a few pointers from one ARIA brother to another. know what you want to research (dont go to them w ""i wanna try research uwu"" cause they got no time to let you burnout), and have some experience in research (ie tough UROPS will condition you well). make sure your resume has some interesting skills that will add well to their groups (ie python, background knowlegde   
 from reading literature, graphic design, etc) and make sure you are sure you wanna stay w them long term (ie ARIA to AGS/NSS(PhD) to AIF to your bond there for 6 years and beyond). Oh, and on that point (ie PhD), a solid first class GPA>4.7 or >4.6 with a double major of course. All these and getting accepted into ARIA should be a breeze.  


\*\*take note: just like any company out there, expect company politics and cannibalising. apparently one of my friends' methodology (whom she shared openly cause it works damn well) got patented by someone in the same research institute within astar.

If the slides are well-organised and have enough info, you could try relying mainly on the slides and skipping the lecture entirely. This worked particularly well on my Pathology lectures, but it really depends on the materials your prof provided.

If that doesn't work, you could try typing down what you think he is saying. If you are unsure about what he said, you could ask him after the lecture. E.g.

noside6,2,"Staying in RC now, my one is called Tembusu, while comparing to other halls like PGP or UTR, PGP rooms are newer but the area is just pretty much just blocks and blocks of rooms, canteen isn't amazing but a lof of them do have AC rooms. UTR rooms seems quite cool with the suite setup as well as closer to all the utown stuff, the room itself is pretty much to the same as the one I have. My room has no AC and it's inside a suite of 6 but we only have 4 this sem, getting used to the no AC life and pretty happy to see the community culture here. Some of the special points of RCs compare to other halls may be: easier to get access to mailboxes and parcels, having the breakfast and dinner provided (though I haven't eaten the food that much as it really isn't that impressive), being closer to the whole UTown area, having the gym and PC commons close by. Overall I would actually prefer RC/ UTR over PGP, and PGP is defintely better than the halls I've not mentioned."

NUS_SPY,5,"I took mech eng. Each core module is roughly half of H2 physics. Try not to overload too much when you are taking core modules because the competition for grades is intense. (like you need to score 80 to 90% to secure an A/A+), 

The workload can vary; consistency is key. For me personally, 2 to 3 hours per day (increase to 4-5 hours if need be) for all modules, including weekends. Include lots of tutorial/lecture practice and supplementary notes. Remember to have a schedule. (I recommend retrospective timetabling)"

NUS_SPY,6,"No, there isn't much catching up in physics as lessons are spread out, with a focus on mechanics in the first half and flow and thermal in the second half (for mech eng), but pay particular attention to forces and dynamics. Your Engineering Principles and Practice module gives a really good overview of what physics concepts is necessary. (like thermal, conservation of mass etc.).

There is more emphasis on calculus and calculations, so remember to brush on your partial derivatives, differential equation, linear algebra (your foundational maths modules)

NUS_SPY,20,"Let me share my personal anecdotes

I scored a B for EG3301R, which is like a design project but for idp students and the intensity is comparable to engineering FYP.

I faced a lot of criticism and my technical competencies are severely questioned. But as long as you take small and consistent steps, you will be quite amazed by the work you have done along the way.

Even if I ventured into another field of engineering (for fyp) which is significantly different, I still hope to maintain an optimistic attitude. Pacing yourself and reiterating your design to supervisor feedback is so important that I cannot stress that enough.

You know what makes it worse? It‚Äôs that I‚Äôm not even overloading.
What a mess, you must think. Yeah it is. I tried to vent out in my own ways: making memes, creating funny spotify playlists and reading things I really like. I believe we all have a long way to go, and that mental health is something crucial than good grades. Hypocritical in an environment like this, but I figured staying alive always outweighs being dead and leaving pain to my fam, my ex and all. This helps me to cope with my suicidal thoughts.

The world is tough, but you surviving it until this day says nothing but the fact that you‚Äôre tougher. If you need a meal or a listener just hit me up.There is no shame in being burnt out or being weak. We are flesh and bone after all.

See his bus swerving to one side at one point."
peace10489,6," I feel.. his company i.e. SBS might have a case to answer and be accountable for, and would be helpful to clarify. 

Does the driver indeed have Tourette's? If so, is he medically certified and assessed by the company, to be fit to drive a bus? Did SBS know he tends to take his wheels off the steering wheel when driving, all the time? The 5Ws and 1H need to be answered regarding his tendency to take his hands off the wheel when driving. 

Our common understanding is that, taking BOTH hands (as he did) off steering wheel when driving, IS dangerous, and causes swerving (as shown in vids).

We are talking about the potential risks serious, fatal accidents can be caused as a result of his ""driving style"", essentially, public lives are at stake.

Shouldn't SBS be responsible and be out to clarify what's going on? How could a driver be allowed to take both his hands off when driving, all the time? 

Now, that has resulted in an accident. It could have been more severe, lives could have been lost."

peace10489,0,"Technically, this is not an accident, now that we know the driver often takes his hands off steering wheel when driving. 

Meaning, those injured can file claims and compensations against SBS, and for endangering other road users. The NUS bus also can lodge a claim. 

Investigations can be carried out, such as retrieving driver cctv and see what happened at the point of accident, whether or not the driver indeed again took his hands off the steering. 

SBS and the authorities should not just treat this as an ""accident"" and sweep it under the carpet."

philoyhc,14,"Just a few points.

1. The new chatbots are tools. In fact, they are among the tools that--probably soon enough, employers and stakeholders will expect you to know how to use (just like the calculator, spreadsheet, word processor, cloud based collab tools, etc.).
2. But like all such tools, there is a difference between ""I know how to crank it to generate an output"" and ""I know enough about the subject matter so that when I use it to generate an output, I can evaluate the output for accuracy and fit for purpose"". If all you know is ""I know how to push the buttons on a calculator"", then, no one can employ you where your actual knowledge in the underlying math is needed, even if they also don't need or want you to do calculations by hand.
3. The double implication of the above for students is that--yes, please feel free to figure out how to use these tools; it's for your own good, and *also* yes, there are plenty of occasions where it wouldn't be to your benefit to be dependent on such tools, and that's also for your own good. In fact, I would say the second point is probably more important when you are still students! If you don't pick up the knowledge and ability to do more than just crank the latest machine and report its outputs without any understanding or value add of your own, the one you are cheating is your future self: you will be first in line to be replaced by a bot.
4. The discussions about the latest chatbots among management started mere days after ChatGPT became available to the public. There are folks in NUS management who not only follow such news but are themselves *researchers* in the domain and cognate fields, so now can any of this be that surprising?! But pushing out a general policy takes time. Nonetheless, some courses are already explicitly working the use of ChatGPT into their workflow (for both instructors and students). More importantly, even without any specially announced policy, representing the output of a chatbot *as if your own work* is conceptually no different from doing the same with some other kind of source--it's plagiarism, and the Student Code Conduct still applies. **So, if you are going to use, learn to use thoughtfully, figure out when it is appropriate, ask your instructors for specific advice, and always acknowledge!**

Pitiful_Emphasis_379,24,"I think ChatGPT is overhyped for what it is.

I won't deny it is a powerful tool. Heck, I use it to search for readings on certain topics and it does return interesting results. However, if you have used ChatGPT enough, you will also know that it isn't consistent. 

I think this is more prevalent for people taking Social Sciences (i.e. not math or science related). I can't even count how many times I've input the same question and ChatGPT returned completely different answers with different points. 

If we can use ChatGPT for tests, I really see no point in having a test in the first place because unlike other means of reference, let's be real, ChatGPT can give decent answers which anyone can blindly copy and if ChatGPT can return different answers for the same questions, imagine how much more you can write if you just combine those different points into one big answer.

Keep ChatGPT to the real world, I think the main focus in university is still to build a strong foundations in the basic. If you need ChatGPT to give you model answers in a test, wouldn't you be questioning what's the point of even getting a university education if you could just drop out, stay at home, and pray ChatGPT has all the answers for you to turn you into some gigachad non-graduate expert which even the top companies would want to hire because you knew how to put questions into ChatGPT."
Pitiful_Emphasis_379,2,"Y2 CHS here. 

It is true that the common core modules are a pain. However, I wouldn't go as far as to say they are just S/U eaters. Truth be told, I did use a bulk of my S/U on them but not because I did terribly bad in them (scored B+ above for them but wanted to pad my CAP like any other students). 

DTK1234 is actually fun, contrary to what a lot have to say about it. Sure, it feels like D&T but, I actually felt it was one of those modules where I was allowed to use my creativity and do something that was unique compared to other modules which have tests and exams. 

Writing wise, the only module that actually had a big writing component was unironically the writing module pillar (FAS1101 for me). Other modules require some form of writing but nothing more than 600 words. Believe me, compared to GP, the writing components for these modules are easier. In fact, your main problem won't even be meeting the word count, but writing above the word count and finding all ways to cut it down. 

Of course, it is all down to personal preference. I just felt that most of the hatred towards CHS common core mods are from people who didn't plan to enter CHS (originally eyed FASS or FoS), or people who found out they were being placed in CHS because of the merger: in other words, the guinea pig batch. I think it should only get better from now on given that they are improving in some shape or form each passing semester. 

I respect people who only wants to focus on their major, nothing wrong with that. I have to say, the common core modules were actually fun because they act as ""free UEs"" so that I can delegate my official UEs to other 2nd majors and minors that I am actually interested in. If not for CHS, I would probably still be debating if I wanna pursue my German and Entrepreneurship minor + Linguistics 2nd major or sacrifice one or the other to try out UEs in design, science, AI, etc."

Being able to draw rudimentary phrasal structure trees has really made me more aware about things like clauses and predicates, which has taught me to better structure my sentences.

Some CCAs out there are actively welcoming members and hosting events to bring in members and interested people."
Pitiful_Emphasis_379,1,"I think internships are important. They are a good way to break into industries and pick up the necessary and relevant skills which university courses might not teach you. 

However, while internships are important, that doesn't mean one should blindly join the bandwagon. Not all internships are created equal. You must still plan it out and take up internship roles that actually make you marketable. Quality over quantity. 

Of course, you can do without internships but you'll need to make up for it in some other way. You can take up extra courses outside of your major. For example, you can take up the CFA program or whack a bunch of courses on Coursera (again, choose your courses wisely). Alternatively, you can be the academic genius and get a First Class and if you happen to not still know what or where you want to work as, you can always detour by getting a Master's and bumping up your r√©sum√© even more (of course, might be harder to get employed as a ""fresh"" Master's graduate). 

I would say, internships are like the toppings on a cake. The cake is you. Your CAP is the icing, and everything else are toppings that top it off. You don't need the toppings but you would at least want your cake to have some icing on it to make it more appealing."
Pitiful_Emphasis_379,12,"Pol Sci major here.

Personally, I have 2 (or 3) tips when it comes to doing readings.

1) Prime your mind

Readings are daunting because the first thing that comes to mind is a big chunk of texts written in academic prose that is hard to understand. If it will be tedious to read, why read? Am I right?

I find that having some sort of primer helps to reduce this feeling. Try watching some videos on YouTube on the topic and see how people superficially (sometimes detailed) explain a concept or theory. Once you have some rough working knowledge, you'll find it easier to follow the readings, and sometimes, the reading might even become interesting because you see an alternative argument to what you have seen; this can be good especially when trying to critic the reading because you have access to two different perspectives.

2) Choose your readings

Let's be honest, not all readings are created equal. If you are going to read just because it is on the module outline, you might as well not read at all. Instead, be smart about it. 

If your module won't test on every single week's content (i.e. your assessment is along the lines of writing an essay on a given topic), focus more on weeks that are relevant to your chosen topic. Prioritize those and treat the other weeks as optional when you want to increase the breadth of your essay. That is a more efficient use of your time because I am sure, you have readings for more than just one module. 

3) Skim through the reading and jump on interesting chapters/points.

Some readings have multiple chapters; skip to chapters that interest you more (in academic literature, the author will usually refer back or forward to another chapter; use that as motivation to read the other chapter once you have grasped the gist of the chapter you read).

If you have only one chapter, skip to parts that are more interesting. Sometimes, what I would do is skip somewhere to the middle of the reading where the author would have long started to elaborate on their key argument. Many fall into reading the intro to each chapter and that will indeed bore you because more often than not, it contains more context-building and less juicy argument on the given topic. 

For example, I am doing this reading on Genghis Khan and the first half of the reading is just the author translating Mongol excerpts to build the context for Genghis Khan's relationships (and hence boring because it feels more like a historical account). It was only near the end where the author went deeper into the political system which is what I was after. 

The above are what works for me.

Of course, find a condusive environment and if you can multitask without getting easily distracted, put on some music (doesn't need to be LoFi, it can be any genre but that depends on you of course; easily distracted = consider LoFi/Classical)."
Pitiful_Emphasis_379,12,Don't be pressured going into a relationship just because others can do it. You have to ask yourself that question.
Pitiful_Emphasis_379,1,"Usually, I don't really care. I try not to wear the same shirt (especially if I decide to be productive and do my laundry halfway though the week) but, if I do happen to wear the same shirt later in the week, well, I don't really care? 

People don't remember what we wear, unless of course you make that fact clear as daylight (i.e., people who don't even bother to switch out of their clothes for the next day). There have even been instances where I wore the exact same combination of shirt + pants + socks + shoes for a tutorial that happens on a weekly basis. 

Outcome? Nobody said anything. 

So, I don't really care. I will only care if I knew I didn't change out my apparel because of some lazy excuse like ""I was too busy studying so I can't bother doing some basic body respect""."
Pitiful_Emphasis_379,0,"I think it is doable. Year 2 Sem 2 here who will have exactly 100MCs worth cleared exactly halfway into my uni course.

In fact, I am only a Single Degree Program student and I am planning to clear close to 200MCs as well (I am taking a 2nd major + 2 minors + other ""interesting"" mods along the way). The only drawback is having to overload every semester. Granted, I have SEP next sem which forces me to push more mods in the following sems thereafter to offset the MCs I have forgone during my SEP sem. Also, do note that like many others, I only took 20MC in my 1st sem of Year 1.

For DDP, I think you have increased min. MCs to facilitate your heavy workload so, take advantage of that. As for whether the CDE and CHS common core overlaps, you may need to check each pillar individually. I think CHS has quite a lot of restrictions if you come from a non-FASS background especially. 

I think double counting shouldn't be too big of an issue considering CDE and CHS courses have very little to do with one another."
Pitiful_Emphasis_379,1,"And I shall elaborate further. There is no such thing as having no major in NUS. At the start of each semester, everyone has to submit an Academic Declaration form; essentially, you have to declare a major and if needed, you can declare your 2nd majors and minors too. For CHS, you can switch majors/minors until the 5th Sem of Study (Year 3 Sem 1). 

So, depending on the major you declare at the start of your first semester, that is how they will allocate the entry module for that major to you (the 1k modules as we call them). Apart from that, you'll have 3 other preallocated modules as part of the CHS curriculum (you need to clear 13 modules in total over your time in NUS) and you'll be given the opportunity to choose another module of your liking (it can be an elective or another module under your major). Do note you'll need to consider if the module you want to take has pre-requisites. Some majors' entry module must be cleared before you can progress. 

So for example, I was allocated PS1101E: Introduction to Politics as I am a PS major. Since PS has barely any pre-requisites for its higher level modules, I also took PS2236: European Politics (and yes, I was the sole Year 1 student in that module that year). 

For now, don't worry about having to choose your major because now, you are simply choosing your ""school"": CHS, CDE, SoC, Business School. Currently, I'd say CHS is the most flexible as you can literally switch between Science and Arts & Social Sciences, or even do both!

I applied under FASS (later CHS because NS) and was deadset at only doing Political Science. 

Now, I am a PS Major, with a 2nd Major in English Language & Linguistics, and a minor in German and Entrepreneurship. I can assure you, the added courses I've taken won't even have been in my mind when I did my application back in 2019 üòâ [Currently Year 2 Sem 2 and I am still looking out for other potential interests, though might be too late since then, I won't graduate in time]."
Pitiful_Emphasis_379,1,"FASS/CHS student here.

In all of my 2 years in NUS, I've never once seen a lecturer or course coordinator give out past year papers to prime us up on what to expect in the midterms of finals. Of course, I acknowledge that different courses require different means of preparation. However, I think they like to set up midterms based on how they are teaching for that specific semester. 

Do note that module coordinators and lecturers change semester to semester (unless the prof has made that module their own). This is why in some instances, asking or providing past year papers is redundant, because the content being taught by Prof A (today) is different from what Prof B (previous sem) had taught. 

That is my experience at least. Sometimes, just taking down very detailed notes and clearing doubts early on is the best way to ace the midterms. Although, sometimes, some mods are ""owned"" by the prof (i.e. they teach the mod every time). They might have past year papers but they can come up with the excuse of ""I won't be testing the same concepts"". 

If you really need PYPs, I would suggest the library (though they may be from eons back and outdated), or personally contacting the course coordinator and see if they have any PYPs to offer. Though, the main issue is f your current prof did not teach the module last semester, then there may not be a relevant recent PYP to practice off of."
Pitiful_Emphasis_379,1,"If I'm not wrong, you can module just about any modules as long as you follow the mapping restriction that each department has. Some departments allow you to map 2 4k modules, while some only allow 1 (just an example). 

Some modules are more flexible as they essentially allow you to map a module to a dummy code. Although, I don't know what exact requirements a SEP module has to have to be mapped to a dummy module. 

In some instances, you might even end up taking a module that has no mapping to any NUS modules. The only drawback is that the credit might not add up since you can't map it. But, why should I not try to get a Latin course and learn to read some Latin?"

Pitiful_Emphasis_379,1,"If I'm not mistaken, the application deadline for FASS SEP Round 2 is between February and March. It is written on the FASS SEP website under ""Before Application"". I will assume this to be right since I applied for Round 1 and I remember doing it back in September, which is in line with the info on the website. 

I don't think FASS will suddenly change the application period without updating their website. Also, do note that Round 2 is only applicable for Sem 2 exchanges! 

Good luck!"
Pitiful_Emphasis_379,4,"Schedule is bound to change. In some instances, the module might not even be offered at all in a given semester or academic year. So yeah, it will be hard to plan the exact modules ahead.

Personally, what I do is have a rough idea of the type of modules I want to clear. For example, if I want to clear a module on Political Theory (I am in Pol Sci), I will think of 2-4 modules under that subset and when the semester comes, I'll see which fits the best. 

Certain modules have a certain pattern (i.e., offered only in Sem 1, only in Sem 2, etc). Try to look out for those patterns, it can help with having a sense of certainty. But of course, the schedule is one thing. Getting modrekt is another Pandora's Box."
Pitiful_Emphasis_379,2,"I would say the merger issues is mostly with CDE. CHS has pretty much settled at this point and even as a pioneer batch of CHS, I would say the merger woes were exagerated. 

As many others have mentioned, NUS College is pretty much a full-time RC for you; compared to other RCs like Tembusu and CAPT which are only two years by default. 

It all boils down to what is your intended takeaway. If you want to build bonds and all that, then NUS College is great. However, I wouldn't make a beeline for it just because some people are voicing out the complications with the merger. The issues a CDE student faces are different from the issues a CHS student faces. Also, the pioneer batch would have gone through two semesters+ by then so, the management would have had the opportunity to streamline the complications. 

The way I see it, taking up extra modules under a RC system is no different from the common core modules that must be cleared under CDE and CHS. 

The difference here is that you pay extra for NUS College yet, you finish with the same degree regardless. So, personally, I always viewed living on campus as a luxury than a need in that regard. Sure. I will be spending three hours of my day commuting to and fro, but at least I'm saving a semester's worth in fees each semester. 

Of course, for some, it may be a need and for some courses, living on campus may be god send. But, those are just different perspectives for different circumstances and realities. I wouldn't say NUS College is worth it if your reasoning is just the woes voiced under CDE because at the end of the day, you are pretty much following the same course structure as a regular engineering student under CDE, with the added or tweaked up requirements to clear your requirements for NUS College. I think the latter would be more complicated in this regard.

Do go for RC if you really need to stay on campus, or if you want to make new friends and build your network early on. There are a lot of interesting people in NUS and you'd be surprised by how fast your network can branch out if you meet the right people!"
Pitiful_Emphasis_379,2,"80ms ping is high? ü§î

I'd say 80ms is quite decent. I play competitive games on the European region with about 160ms-200ms ping and I'd say it's not even a bad ping so long as there are no packet loss. Still, that doesn't stop me from being in the Top 5000 of players there PepeHands. 

My advice for you is to run a pingplotter trace and see whether it is an ISP problem or a routing problem. I play World of Tanks on the Hong Kong server and due to some routing issues, I get like 300ms ping there on some days compared to 160ms on Europe XD. My last understanding is that the cable from Singapore to Hong Kong always gets loose or something, which causes packet loss. If your connection to the server runs through Hong Kong, that might be a reason."
Pitiful_Emphasis_379,19,"I think for such things, there are no limitations. You could take all the modules under the sun and face no issues, provided of course you meet every single prerequisites. Although, the only limit I know of is the max no. of MCs countable for 1k modules, currently at 60MCs. This means you can technically take 80MCs of 1k modules (for whatever reason) but only 60MCs will count to your MC requirements for graduation. Although, the grades for each and every module will still affect your CAP even if the MC is not counted to your graduation requirement.

So, thread the thin line carefully. For UE, it depends on your home faculty I think. I am from CHS so, our UE is at 48MCs. Yours can be more or less, but same logic should apply as with the graduation MC requirement. 

Correct me if I'm wrong!"
Pitiful_Emphasis_379,1,I guess you can try contacting your professor and see if they can manually swap your tutorial slot.
Pitiful_Emphasis_379,3,"I don't have the highest CAP (~4.5 at time of application) and I wasn't in any CCAs too. I got accepted to exchange with University College Dublin in Round 1. I am from FASS/CHS too.

To be completely honest, nobody knows how they really choose. I'd say my CAP is more or less average or above average compared to those who are actually giving their all for SEP. And CCA is out of the question for me. 

I'd say, perhaps, no. of vacancies and your personal statements (for FASS) might have some degree of importance. I remember writing a very detailed, explicit, and fluffed up personal statement. Then again, Ireland is quite off radar compared to its neighbor across the water. I think 6 or 7 of us were accepted for UCD. 

I'd say, try to scout out for less popular universities for SEP, unless you have a perfect CAP and CCA records. Personally, I want to go for SEP for the experience so, I was fine with going anywhere within Ireland (since I have relatives there). 

I won't say CAP is the sole determiner. However, many people can end up applying with more or less similar CAPs so, there has to be another determiner. It could be CCA, it could be your Personal Statements, it could be demand v. supply, it could be all down to luck too."

For CEG you can take either IA or ATAP to fulfil the internship requirement so before applying I filtered internships on talentconnect from both sides to see what possible jobs I can apply but I just wacked application and forgot that I am apparently supposed to apply only to one side?

Quoting from https://ceg.nus.edu.sg/ia/

>While CEG students may apply for industrial attachment OR internship, via either CDE (IA/VIA) or SoC (ATAP/SIP), please DO NOT apply both sides, then decide on the ‚Äòpreferred‚Äô offer ‚Äì it does not leave a positive impression to reject an offer. Also, it will affect another applicant.

Can any CEG seniors advice me on what to do here? I have received replies from both sides for potential interviews and I think it might be too late for me to withdraw my applications. Also are we not allowed to reject offers? I was under the impression that students can get multiple job offers and just pick one. The only caveat is not to renege after accepting one of them.

Popular_Mortgage6893,1,went on holiday since its last sem best sem and i only have 10mcs with no midterms ü§≠
Popular_Mortgage6893,3,"Matriculated with a second major in biz analytics but dropped to a minor because I couldn‚Äôt cope with the technical skills needed to code + didn‚Äôt meet the requirement to keep second major (min B+ in CS1010s & BT1101). No regrets dropping bc based on previous requirements (not sure if it has changed with the revision of MCs required for minors and second majors) but I would have needed to take 168MCs total to fulfil all my requirements (majors, faculties, general). I would advise to go for it if you have background knowledge and confident in coping with the coding + workload. Coming from zero background, the learning curve is steep with all the languages that I had to learn (R, Python, SQL, MongoDB). The sheer volume of modules is also a huge consideration, as the second major fills all your UEs, which means you don‚Äôt have modules to ‚Äúsacrifice‚Äù and its hard to overload. 
Overall, I‚Äôm quite happy that I took a minor in the end as it gave me the exposure and basic understanding of the various coding languages out there. I wouldn‚Äôt say I‚Äôm proficient in the languages but at least my foundation is there such that if I need to learn it I can pick it up at a faster rate. With regards to work, the skills are definitely important with all the technical interviews you have to clear, but you need not necessarily need the spec/major if you are willing to put in the work in your own time. Personally, I didn‚Äôt enjoy learning coding through modules due to the tight deadlines that made me more focused on getting the answer rather than figuring out the coding process.
Hope this helps! Cheers"
Popular_Mortgage6893,18,"tldr: you can cope by setting the right expectations with your partner on the frequency of your meetings and your priorities at your current season of life.

s/o and i started dating when i was in Y2 and he was Y4. it helped a lot at first because we were both still studying i was staying in hall at the time, so we shared a lot of common time together (we saw each other almost every other day). but as the AY progressed, because he was from SOC, his FYP was consuming a lot of him time while i'm from FASS. for me, it took a while to get used to the fact that he simply didn't have the time to spend with me because his FYP was urgent, and i guess in relationship what really makes things work is setting the same level of expectation. so he got busier, i had to grow to be more understanding that he needed the time to finish his project to graduate.

even now as my s/o is working and i am in y4, i would say we have grown into the ""typical"" routine of a singaporean couple, where we'd meet once a week on friday nights for dinner. once a week is a significant drop from the days when we were both schooling of around 4-5 times a week, but its just a new normal that we both had to get used to given our current circumstances. the frequency/duration of the time you see your s/o isn't telling of your importance/priorities of them, its also sometimes determined by the circumstances you find yourselves in. we generally keep to friday night dinners + the occasional weekend outings because it works for us to let my s/o have a good rest on working days and for me to settle my studies/internships on the weekdays. even if things come along that demands more of each of our time (eg. finals season), we know how to talk it out to set the expectation that momentarily, one person needs a bit more time away from the other to focus on the other demands of our lives to complete it well.

all in all, it takes a lot of communication and effort to make the most of the time that you spend together. i understand that there are different type of couples out there, but i would say that if you can make the most of the time spent together, as well as understand your s/o's full plate of priorities, a good partner should be understanding enough to know when to compromise when you need more time away. but for yourself, i guess the important questions to ask is where your priorities lie and how much time are you willing to sacrifice to nurture your relationship?"

putinism,2,"For industrial and systems engineering (ISE), physics is nonexistent in the course but you'll still need to take the physics bridging mod cos it's an engineering requirement."
putinism,1,NOC SEA 3 months results were released last Friday. Haven't heard anything about the 6months/1yr NOC yet.
putinism,1,"Sorry for reviving a dead thread, generally u'll be doing ISE core and elective mods and then choose to specialise in a system of your choice (varying from eng to cs to is). The content in the core mods and elective mods vary quite heavily, with some being systems focused while the rest being more stats/data analytics focused. Do note that some mods are only offered in one sem. Off the top of my head and based on those that I have taken these is a general overview of the mods.

Core Mods (pass all 5):  
IE2111 (sem2) - Engineering economics, replacement analysis, time value of money, etc. Working extensively with excel and the at risk extension.  
IE2110 (sem1) - linear programming, nonlinear programming, dijkstra, hungarian method, etc. Quite a bit of math.  
IE2141 (sem1/sem2) - Stella Architecture, laws of systems thinking, etc. This would be an introduction to systems thinking. After this mod, I never once touched stella architecture, but the concepts (sometimes feels like common sense) are useful in modelling complex systems.  
IE3105 (sem1) - Builds upon ie2141; doesn't have any prereq, generally about systems thinking again.  
IE3102 (sem1/sem2) - year long project that is similar to a fyp/milestone project where u work on an industrial project with deliverables graded by ISE profs.  


Elective Mods (pass 2):  
CS2113T (sem1/sem2) - relevant if u going swe/devops I guess.  
IE3101 (sem1) - quite stats heavy, builds on st2334 concepts, point estimates, CI, Hypo Testing, some proving involved as well. Difficult concepts but the prof is quite clear in teaching them.  
IE3110R (sem1) - has a reputation amongst ISE students for being difficult. Using statistical tools to simulate a real life problem for ur project.  
IE3250 (sem2?) - seems like a new mod; old code seems to be ie2150 with the same module name.  
IE4240 (sem1) - apparently similar to pf1101.  
IE4243 (sem2) - MCDA, FMEA, Decision models, Stochastic Dominance, Decision Tree, etc.  
IE5231 (sem1) - Grad Data Analytics mod, not sure what's it about.  


System mods:  
Not too sure about all of these, seems like a mix bag of management/technical/stats mods based on what you choose. Systems thinking is a multidisciplinary field of engineering and should complement your main major/your interested field of study. In retrospect systems engineering is pretty broad at a glance, it changes from role to role based on your field and involves both technical and non-technical aspects of a project. Systems engineering is slightly different from the main ISE curriculum as the main ISE curriculum has computing(cs1010e/cs2040) and math mods(ma1083/ma15111/ma1512) along with stats/ml (ie2100, ie4211, ie4213, etc.) related mods."

&#x200B;

I am a Computer Science applicant considering whether to indicate my interest in applying to NUS college. I have a confusion: Is the application of NUS college and the regular NUS application separate? Or, asking differently: Will applying to the NUS college affect my regular application to NUS? Based on what I learned, the application to NUS college is way more competitive than the regular application to NUS. Let's say; my profile is strong enough to get admitted into NUS as a CS major but not competitive enough to succeed in my NUS college application. Would my indication of 'interest in the consideration of NUS college' make my application unsuccessful? Although my first choice is NUS college + CS major; however, a CS major without NUS college is way better than an unsuccessful application. Do you have any suggestions?

RayneRaiku,5,"I have no idea what is SURP but I did a quick google the website says:

>SURP will take place during 24 June‚Äì19 August 2023 for eight weeks. Students are expected to devote at least 20 hours per week to the research project. Supervisors will discuss the actual time commitment with their students upon admission.

This will probably eat into the 1st 2-3 weeks of your Y2S1 semester.

>But I told her I got rejected by NUS alrdy but she was confused and said she didn‚Äôt reject me yet. So she asked me to send her the email so she can check..not sure what this means? Am I rejected or do I still have a chance?

Most people on reddit wouldn't really know if you have a chance since we ain't even the administrators of this programme so if you wish to clarify it is better to just email the coordinators of this programme (especially the NUS side since you got rejected here)."
RayneRaiku,14,"If you wish to do research/academia, you will hentak kaki at research assistant with only a Bsc, research associate with masters. Research fellow and above only for PhDs.

If you wish to work at companies then I believe your performance in that company matters more than academic qualifications, though senior positions typically would require at least a masters (not necessarily in Life Sciences can be in management like MBA).

Most if not all graduates with Life Science will qualify for junior positions but you will be stuck there without further education."
RayneRaiku,3,Yes the IGP applies to social work.
RayneRaiku,1,"I didn't take both of these minors but one thing I would advise is that when you come to NUS, take both of the introductory modules from these minors/majors then from there make up your mind. Sometimes the module description / minor programme description may not really show the full picture of what the minor entails, and you wouldn't even know if you like to study the minor until you have taken the introductory module.

Also, this is responsibility can only be given to medical doctors."
RayneRaiku,2,Yes NUS Halls accept exchange students. I know an exchanger in my hall who stayed for sem 1 and sem 2.

RayneRaiku,2,"You can look up on which modules can double count for your majors in science and engine so the total MCs can be lower than 180 MCs. The restriction is 16MCs for double majors, I think it should be the same for double degrees too (correct me if I'm wrong), so technically you could graduate taking only 164 MCs."

I mean, yes, following the latter will probably give you a higher starting salary, but in a long run, you wouldn't be able to grow as fast as your peers who have more interest/passion in the field and that the boom may not always be there.

And, if you are still confused, I would suggest going for something more general, e.g. mechanical engineering. It's a more general degree in a sense that you get a taste of a bit of everything -- materials, electronic systems, manufacturing, .... You can then choose to deepen your knowledge in a field that you prefer more after getting exposure to those fields. 

Disclaimer: I am from mechanical engineering so I may be biased towards my own program"
reddit_win1,9,"By and large, the grades are still curved. But, the competition is less tough than undergrad, because for one, masters don't have degree classification. And, ya, some people take it part-time, so they don't have all the time to study like undergrads :))"

If you intend to move into the industry, then overseas/local I don't think it significantly matters. They look into your skillsets more rather than which university you are from, given that you are from a reasonably reputable university.

If you intend to teach in the local universities, I suppose it's much better to stay overseas, do some postdoc, before going to teach here. Otherwise, generally, you will still need to go overseas before you can come back and teach in the unis.

reddit_win1,4,"I think for Masters degree (especially in Engineering), it really depends on what you really want to do.

If probably you are going for R&D (in the industry/academia), then, masters (by research) and beyond is of course definitely a must have. In most cases, it is not really about the knowledge, since your research will be on a very specific topic, but your research skills are definitely of value.

If you are talking about going industry as an engineer, then masters (by coursework) and bachelors, as far as I understand, don't really make a high difference. It wouldn't be the case that like once you get masters then you will get a much higher pay/bumped up immediately in ranks. It's the work experience that matters more, since things at work are not always by the textbook, but only that when you do it you know what works and what doesn't (i.e. gut feel).

I mean, in any case, if they are willing to fund your masters, then so be it. I don't think there's any harm in doing it. Only downside is that (obviously) you will start work 1-1.5 years later than your peers/batchmates. 

Company sponsorship wise, just take note of how much bond you are required to serve with your company. Unless that you are sure you want to stay with the company, then take the bond, but otherwise, you may want to think about it :)

P.S. The above is my own thoughts, so take it with a pinch of salt. Have a good weekend ahead!"

I also get bored from attending the lessons but internships wise, no employers will ask you to start pulling out every theory you know from marketing and apply it to real life, so you don‚Äôt have to worry on the theory part.

RoamingArchitect,1,"It varies a lot. I would say a 90-92 per cent quota for English or Singlish outside class seems about right. Some classes are in Chinese so they can offset what would usually be a hundred per cent English during classes (but for the average student you can assume a hundred per cent). About 5 per cent outside class is Chinese in various dialects and the rest is all over the place with various foreign students and professors. As a German exchange student my most frequent languages are English followed by German (with friends and one professor), then Japanese (mostly with professors outside class), then Mandarin or Cantonese Chinese (in a rudimentary way when others are speaking Chinese and I can contribute in Chinese)."

ROD_OF_AGES,5,"The other comments speak the truth. If you don't get A+ (Not even A) for CS1010E, then don't even consider CS.

However, CEG might still be OK. Not to say it's worse than CS or anything. Considering you're already in CDE, it won't be as big a change.

I've taken/taking some courses that are frequented by CEG students, namely CS2040C, CS2113, and CS4240. These are still OK, and CS2113 is wayyyyy simpler than CS2103 (And even teaches some stuff that are covered in CS2030). 

Now, this is all based on CS1010E grade but it's possible you can improve after having taken the module. So, you can take either CS2030 or CS2040(C) (or variants) and see if you want to continue. Like the other commenter, I suggest 2040 over 2030 first as 2040 is required for both streams and imo is very fundamental to CS.

I took CS2040C as a gauge before I decided to pursue other CS modules.

Outcome 1: Too hard, drop, forget about CS/CEG.
Outcome 2: Doable, continue, these are necessary modules for CS anyway. (CEG doesn't need CS2030)"

runtuimcha,1,"I mean we have to first admit that everybody has an accent but the point is whether we can communicate. If the prof has a Liverpool accent or a Scottish accent, that might be challenging for students to understand as well. The existence of accent should definitely be acknowledged. 

And in this case, I would like to suggest that you may point out this issue to him in a humble way rather than an offensive way. Most of the time, genuineness and politeness can help you overcome the difficulties of interpersonal communication. Just write an email and express that you like most parts of his module and respect the diversity but the comprehension of lecture is really a barrier to success in this module for you. He will understand and find a way to figure it out.

You know, profs are not here to set barriers for students and they are supposed to help students comprehend the course materials, which is a part of their job. It‚Äôs only about teaching but not racism, right? Just don‚Äôt worry and go ahead."

ryanlowwj,3,"Year 2 CHS/life sciences student here. In my 4th sem of RVRC

1. Most of the mods will make reference to topics surrounding environment/sustainability at some point, but there is only really 1 mod (RVN) that focuses entirely on the environment part. To my knowledge, being in a related major won‚Äôt boost your chances of admission - the people around me are all from different courses, and I don‚Äôt see any over-representation of environmental studies-related majors.

2. The RVRC mods replace some of the CHS mods you will need to take, and I honestly found it a godsend because you don‚Äôt have to fight with the rest of CHS to bid for some of these mods (since the RV mods get pre-allocated to you). Also, some of the RV mods are arguably more interesting than the CHS equivalent. For example as a CHS science student, the mod to clear the writing pillar is about academic/scientific writing, which most people find really dry. The RVRC equivalent has several options to choose from, including film studies and science fiction.

3. Yes we do get quite a number of insects esp around the rainy season. I personally use a mosquito net to cover my windows and I leave the windows open 24/7 -zero insects for me!

4. Historically yes it is tough, as AC rooms are limited, so I think management tends to prioritise people with medical reasons (like skin problems). That being said, there is construction going on now to install aircon in more rooms, so the competition should be less severe by the time you apply.

5. I found RVRC mods really interesting as a person who likes hands-on work (like field work and excursions). If you prefer more abstract lesson content, then the UTCP mods offer more of those. RV mods are generally focused on real world problems and skills.

6. I would respectfully disagree. I personally found RV campus life really vibrant, and it depends on you finding your community and people you can vibe with in the college - this applies to all RCs/halls/houses. You may be in the most popular residence, but if you don‚Äôt make the effort to participate and find your community, you stand to lose out wherever you go. RVRC in particular is a really mixed bunch, ie we don‚Äôt have one single personality that comes as a result of the intake screening process for freshmen (as compared to other RCs). So there‚Äôs a little bit of something for every personality and every interest.

7. Officially, someone keen in learning real world skills and with a passion for sustainability. Unofficially (don‚Äôt quote me) someone who genuinely intends to participate actively in college activities.

8. No idea, but to my knowledge no

9. Also no idea as these details are usually confidential, but I do come across people in RV from a really wide range of backgrounds, so I would say there isn‚Äôt a RP requirement.

10. Most rooms are quiet, other than the temporary construction noise that other comments have mentioned. Maybe if you get a room facing the road, there may be vehicle noise."
Ryougi1702,1,"If ur on a bit of a budget:
I‚Äôm using a Lenovo ThinkPad E495 which was bought in 2019 with 3year onsite warranty for $1000 (actually 900 cos i used a voucher).

Keep in mind this was modded (not by me, u can choose the parts u want on lenovo site) with more ram and more storage so if u want the default one its probably $600-$700 ish
I also did alot of gaming that this laptop was not designed for (was hospitalised for a while and was quite literally on the laptop almost 24/7) and it still holds up q well today.

Though if u can going for a newer thinkpad with a bigger screen, better mic and speakers would be much more comfortable; as i have run into problems with window sizes being annoyingly small for programs like examplify.

saiiNnT,8,"Hi there! I'm a Lit Major here in FASS & I do a ton of readings every week & yeah, they are extremely challenging whenever you feel like you've got nothing to jot down nor any ideas to develop on. I reckon it must be even harder for history readings because they are purely information based and it can be really difficult. 

However, I hope I can give you some tips on how to **attempt** to annotate and make notes for yourself. 

1. It's crucial to understand that jotting down notes + annotation isn't something that is ridiculously easy and that it isn't something that comes upon reading a new piece of information. So don't worry if you feel you aren't doing your best/struggling to internalize, regurgitate, and respond accordingly. Keep it up! 

2. In attempting to annotate readings, I suggest first finding the purpose for the reading. I know that most readings are assigned and not of free-will (unless of course, you're a masochist). They often have to do with something you're covering, or something the professor wants you to deliberate on. Therefore, approach the reading by knowing what the purpose is. With that in mind, use that purpose to inform your thought process and how you may go about tackling the reading. Using the history example, I'd say that even if it's purely information-based, there are still nuggets of ""opinion-based"" rhetoric that the author will tend to jot down. They may seem the objective truth but the nuance of reading papers is that there are always opinions, embedded in the text or subliminal. As such, question that opinion & question the information that follows the opinion. Some noteworthy annotation-styles might be in the following forms: 

- ""Why did the author write this? Check validity"" 
- ""Any cross-references?""
- ""That doesn't seem right... Seems questionable""
- input-your-own-idea-here 

Hopefully, with what I provided above, you may be able to understand that annotation is really a tool to further your own understanding, or as a tool to look at the reading from multiple perspectives and foci. I'd say attempt to annotate only where there is a need, but you can also annotate as and when you are engaging with the text (even with a little checkmark/underline). 

I hope some of this may have helped you. I understand how truly difficult and challenging annotations may be and the worst feeling is a clean paper with 0 markings on them. But to truly engage with your texts, you must first dig deep into the why and hows of the paper itself. After that, try to engage (even if it's purely historical because really, histories are not linear, but may have interesting nuggets of histories that also happen concomitantly but are missed out on that you can help improve on by adding your own points/research). Hope I helped, OP. Good luck."

ScrewEverything,11,"Find avenues in your life to speak more to strangers in public. If you suffer from social anxiety like I did, start small like ordering pizza by calling the pizzeria instead of ordering online, then progress to face to face communication with 1 person (e.g. take the initiative to call for waiter in the restaurant or at a cafe inquire about the type of coffee or make small talk with canteen auntie etc).

This method of incrementally increasing my exposure to 'public speaking' gave me more and more confidence until I was able to just wing presentations and speeches to hundreds of people. Remember that everyone is just faking it till they make it. 

This is actually a very useful skill outside of sch and work tbh, just last week I went to a new gym in the US with my friends and cos of my thick skin I asked if they could give first timers a discount, and the front desk guy let 4 of us in for the price of 2 lol"

2. Gaming laptops tend to spoil faster compared to a gaming desktop due to bad airflow and high temps.

My recommendation is to get a light MacBook for school to do your coding stuff. Then get a powerful Windows desktop with strong GPU for gaming at home.

shappirand,2,"based on what you‚Äôve mentioned, it seems that you‚Äôre more interested in the idea of doing a CS with Math second major, rather than taking the course itself - do be wary of that subtle difference

you mentioned that you‚Äôre interested in quant finance. yes, CS + math does provide a pretty decent platform to go for those roles; but do be prepared to do lots of grinding. theoretical, algorithmic, logical, behavioural, and even trivia-based questions, since you‚Äôll be competing with pretty much the mathiest people out there

i‚Äôve heard that quant firms tend to prefer PhDs (usually in a mathy field - math, cs, physics), and it might be worth considering doing a PhD, otherwise if you get lucky, CS + math bachelor‚Äôs will do just as fine

Here are some questions to prospective students struggling to decide and also seniors currently in these courses!! 

1. Why did you choose DSE over Info Security or vice versa? (For instance, does one stand a higher employment rate over the other?)

2.  Do DSE graduates face a greater competition over those in Info Security? (Given the similarity in course modules among DSE DSA BA students)

3. Since Info security is such a niche area of study, are the career paths limited for its graduates? 

4. How wise is it to enter Info Security out of interest (which may not sustain) ? Does IS open up to career paths outside of cyber security in case one were to prefer other IT related positions?

I mean after all this kind of worries will keep recurring over and over again. So rather than over thinking about all these at this point in time when you're pretty much powerless to do anything, do something that you have control over. I'm sure that you'll figure things out along the way as the days past."

I then gave feedback regarding the prof's accent during evaluation.

I decided I didn't want to tell the prof to his face that I couldn't understand him because I don't like confrontation. Also, even though profs should be fair and objective, it's hard for someone to not let the criticism they receive from someone color their judgment, like during grading. So I'd rather play it safe.

sofishtikate,1,"with 77.5rp (without the inclusion of the 2.5 bonus points), what are my chances for nus chs (psychology major) with aba?"
Soft_Rip_1195,4,"0. Easiest way to tell is the worst way aka trial by fire by just enrolling and trying 1 semester of the course, then switching majors if you really cant stand it. A better way is googling the degree requirements and researching the modules that you have to take by searching for past reviews of them on nusmods or assorted blogs - Youll get a rough idea of what you will learn in each module and what kind of coursework will be assigned to you.

1. I got into CS because I enjoyed the problem solving aspect of coding (and because I sucked at everything else so I had no other choice but lets just ignore that part). I enjoy learning about the technologies we use day-day and what goes on ""under the hood"" in my PC (E.g. OS and networks). I also love the dopamine hit I get when my code compiles and produces the expected result.

2. There's almost always going to be modules that you fucking hate but have to take as part of your degree requirements - see point 0 about doing your own research into the course curriculum. As a freebie : A lot of CS modules involve programming assignments, if you dislike debugging then I hope you have god tier skills and can write a fully functional program that meets the requirements on your first go."

sou_23,35,"To answer your questions:

\- UCS Counselling is free, and you can walk in or make an appointment.

\- Yes, as part of the protocol they will always ask if you have had suicidal thoughts or thoughts of harming others. But they won't escalate the matter unless there is a real risk to anyone (your own or others') safety. If it's still just intrusive thoughts, it should be safe to share that you've been affected by such thoughts.

\- Regarding housing, I don't know so I can't answer your question. 

\- However, UCS maintains confidentiality (all your info is only kept within UCS, and not shared to the rest of NUS or any other health institution/system) UNLESS your safety or someone else's safety is at real risk. So I don't think it's likely that it'll affect anything.

\- I'm not sure what you mean by ""visiting""? If I assume you mean ""will I be allowed to visit the NUS campus"", then well they can't stop you since NUS mostly is open to the public (there aren't even gates in most places).

\- Also, you can request to switch to a different counsellor if you don't vibe with your current one.

\- Personally I've benefitted from my experience at UCS, and I hope you find it useful too. Give it a shot, it's free after all. I hope you manage to work through your feelings in good time, please take care and know that at least this one stranger cares!

Semester 4.  CAP: 3.16,  4  modules 
Student status-Passed 

This was my last chance at this. At this point, I had spent all the money that needed to be spent on this degree. It has to be done and since I took all 4 statistics modules,it was war. 
I got Covid again flying in to the semester. At this point, covid was like the common flu for me and it passed quite easily. 

I did a few things right in the semester- 
1. Consistently attend all classes and paid attention, annotating my notes with details in class. 
2. Did assignments in groups. Had 3-4 people work on every assignment independently to cross-check and make sure I beat the normal curve in assignments at least. No need to conquer everything on your own. 
3.  Deprioritise everything else- I took only as much as I could handle on my plate. Made it a point to not take up internship work during semester time, eased up on my leadership work as well. Just singular focus on my studies. 
4. Started applying myself more, trying out past year questions, asking profs questions on emails regularly, trying out problems on my own. 
5.Serendipity not luck: Met a NUS PHD student and took his help consistently. He was valedictorian in his statistics undergrad at NUS and was super helpful and has his concepts clear to their very core. 

When the result came for this semester, I had a very good feeling about it- I had done everything that needed to do be done. Exams felt more doable yet still very hard but you know what,I had done all that I could. I still had that looming fear of failure but I did not let that stop me. I also learned the more you fear failure, the more you become susceptible to it. It‚Äôs like how pilots are never told, ‚Äúdon‚Äôt crash your plane‚Äù cause it makes them more susceptible to crashing it. 

Semester 5.  CAP: 3.34,  4  modules 
Student status-Passed & Graduated finally

Last semester was thematically more about trying to find a job with academics being a key theme as well. I understand my privilege to being allowed to take a semester extra. At this point, I knew how to stats enough in the right way to get by and did the needful. 

However, the trauma is very real- I could not sleep  the night before the result and was dripping in anxiety. I opened my CAP Calculator and contemplated the worst of worst situations that could happen. I had also decided what I‚Äôd say to the department in my plea if I fail.  

When I opened the result at 7am,  having refreshed the portal about a thousand times since the night before, I could not believe it. I got an A, A-, B+, B and not any Cs.I graduated. 


‚Ä¶..

Life update (Feb 2022)- Got my dream job and my degree. 

I am sharing this experience so you could inspired in some way if you are struggling. Academic struggles are real at a place like NUS but people don‚Äôt like to talk about academic failure, but it‚Äôs a part of the game. It can be really hard to deal with if you are a sincere, hardworking kid with a good track record so you aren‚Äôt used to dealing with such situations.

Mods-wise, Hanyang is extremely popular amongst engin students (esp mech engin), so if you're one of them, you have many options. I can also tell you with certainty that the least amt of effort I put into an NUS mod is still more than any effort I put in on summer exchange (I mapped MKT3702 and FIN2704X for reference).

Y2S1: CS2100, CS2105, CS2109S, CS2103T, MA2108, CS2101, 1 fluff

Y2S2: CS2106, CS3230, ST2132, 1 CS 3k, 1 MA 3k

Y2 special term: SIP 

Y3: Thesis, remaining CS electives, 2 MA 3k electives, 1 fluff

&#x200B;

You only need a D to get a S grade if u SU your fluffs, and it is exceedingly hard to get F grades, so you can basically shit out essays in 5 minutes for all of your non-CS/MA mods (and for ES2660 and CS2101 too, because they are non-technical mods) and spend \~5 mins/week on the fluffs. Attendance optional too because you only need a D grade. 

&#x200B;

You would prob want to leave less work for Y3 because of the thesis. Can PM me for details"

suffian87,12,"no! you're supposed to keep practising your interview every week. and edit your resume to get a higher score if possible. jokes aside, just focus on your major modules. don't worry about it!"
suffian87,15,"These are some of my experiences in NUS. When I was waiting for one of my lecture, this random girl asked me if I was waiting for the lecture. And she was sweet enough to let me know that the lecturer had cancelled the lecture. I was too busy doing my work that I didn‚Äôt check my mails. I really appreciate her bothering to take some time to let me know. 

Another time I had covid, my guy friend already took a module and he sent me his notes to help me catch up. I really appreciate his help. I can never repay him back with my notes because he‚Äôs already on a level much higher than me. 

I can just keep on going on and on. But these random acts from friends and strangers help to make me feel part of NUS even though we may all be scattered all over the place. Heck, I even spot a stranger removing a crawling ant on another person‚Äôs shirt while on a bus, with permission of course. Haha!

Tbh, the way I see it, we should strive to make others feel welcomed more instead of just expecting others to welcome us. It goes both ways. Same reason why if I see y1, I‚Äôll help them along. Yes, it can be obvious who are the y1s, they tend to be the most excited ones while getting themselves lost in sch.

So, a sense of belonging? You get as much as you give. For me now, I‚Äôm just seeing more students/alumnus outside wearing NUS T-shirts. And my weird sense of belonging is me squealing deep inside, oh! That‚Äôs my schoolmate! Heh!"
suffian87,7,Need to scan. So u definitely need to either be a student or a staff. I normally enter only to shower after gym. Nice hot showers. Haha!
suffian87,2,"Probably depends on your major and your strategy. If your major is just maths, physics, chemistry or somewhere along that line, it‚Äôs definitely useful to get some minor or 2nd major. Probably like CS or QF. Similarly if you‚Äôre from FASS. Being a Jack of all trade is good if you‚Äôre not sure which industry you‚Äôre going into. But if you already know where you wanna work at, just make sure to choose the right modules to maximise your chance getting into it.

For me, I‚Äôm clearing most of major mods right now. I‚Äôve cleared DSA1101, CS1101, QF1101, probably in y3 or y4, I‚Äôll be clearing more mods to slowly upgrade to a minor. And probably in y4, then I‚Äôll confirm either a 2nd major or not. 

If you still can‚Äôt decide, you can go through each year and decide later. Your CAP will probably determine your next step. And probably why clearing 32 MC in y1 is a good Strat. Just S/U time wasting mods to have more time in y2-4."
suffian87,52,Sometimes I wonder if I‚Äôm overdressed. Cos I‚Äôll bathe every morning without fail. Find something nice to wear. And with deodorant and some perfume if I‚Äôm feeling it. Why? It helps to make me more productive and last till the end of the day.
suffian87,5,"Yes. Even if another dryer is unused. If the wash/dryer is set for 1hr, I‚Äôll put a timer for 50min, make my way down in 5 mins or so. And wait for the remaining time."
suffian87,2,"As long as you can explain how you get the W grade. If you‚Äôre overloading a lot, it shouldn‚Äôt be a prob. But if you‚Äôre already on 20 MCs, it may be a slight issue.

I see it as a plus point. If they ask me that, it may means 1 lesser interview question."
suffian87,1,Wait. How is ma2001 up there?
suffian87,2,"Don‚Äôt worry too much. Sometimes, I have the imposter syndrome. It makes me feel as if I‚Äôm crashing the lecture instead. You‚Äôre definitely an imposter but nobody really cares."

SurveyGhost,2,"If you have nothing else to do (no internship) then orbital is good.

Free 4mcs for being able to do any project of your choice. If you just want a small project or just want to focus on your project without all the extra stuff (detailed documentation, test cases, diagrams, scrum etc) then just take the lower levels.

Take the higher level of orbital only if u want to try getting awards. (But u have to be in Artemis level to qualify for any, I hardly see any Apollo projs win)

End of the day the proj u make matters more than the orbital level.  (This is provided u put in actual effort into your proj) 

For interviews, never in my life have people ask abt my orbital proj achievement level LOL they did however asked abt my orbital proj itself and it has scored me internships."
SurveyGhost,1,"Depends on which course u were in for poly. My poly was project and programming focus, going to NUS for the programming mods were fine since most impt when programming was the thought process. Transition for those were not that bad. 

The issue was the amt theory at nus and the math modules that assume u have A level knowledge ü§°

NUS really goes in-depth for their content, and most of it leans to the theory side. A lot of mods don‚Äôt have enough coding practicals to apply your knowledge. I like being able to apply the content taught through coding so that was a huge bummer. Went to poly because it was hands on, but nus leans way too much to the theory side :("

swjs00,4,Omg I thought I was the only one who watches TLoU
swjs00,10,"Damn op, I have the same regrets as you, except the schools are in different order. I rejected NUS CEG to take NTU EEE because I felt electrical engineering was a greater passion (and NTU EEE's marketing was very strong). Turns out, I cant vibe with the student community in NTU, and I fair so much better in computing than engineering. I realized this in y2, but I decided to double down on engineering, hoping things would improve. I put in more effort than ever before. But nothing improved. Now, in y4, ive cut my losses and focus solely on computing. In addition, seeing my friends who started off on the same footing as me become  far so much better than me because they did cs and ceg makes me extremely envious and regretful. (Just to be clear, I dont wish for them to fail. Im extremely happy for them.  They are extremely hard workers, and I look up to them. I just wish I couldve been there too.) I beat myself up everyday for it, wishing I could rewind time.

But once in a while I smoke copium and realize that there was no way I couldve known back then. I took a bet that turns out to be wrong. It might handicap me in the first few years of my career, but at least now I know where to focus my efforts starting from now. It also helps me absorb the blow knowing that these people I am envious of also had their own setbacks many years back (we have been close friends for a long time), and watching them succeed now gives me strength and hope that things will improve for me too. While I may not be able to offer u solace, I hope you may find comfort in the fact that you are not the only one who made a stupid decision, that there was no way you could have had a complete picture back then, and that you still have a chance to start where you are and pivot to where you wish to be.

op, I wish us both the best of luck, hopefully we can meet when we both succeed in getting what we want"

Something else you can try. Take one day as a challenge and force yourself to put your hand up. Take a breath before you say something. Nothing wrong with looking at the notes in front of you. I wouldn‚Äôt map out a speech though, use bullet points. And keep it simple. Prof can ask you to elaborate if s/he wants more. Trying to say something ‚Äúbrilliant‚Äù may only come across as overly complicated or obscure. You can also start by asking questions, rather than giving answers. Profs love to talk.

I've asked my parents for advice and my mum was not too fond of that idea. She said BBA gives me more 'paths' in the workforce, and something along the line that I'd be able to 'climb higher' with BBA. She also said I don't have CS background and I might not fare well in CS. I heard that BBA is more for the extroverts? I'm quite introverted myself and that's one of the reason why I'm considering CS. Also CS starting salaries in surveys seem to be higher? I really need some advice on this. Which one would y'all recommend?"

taenyfan95,5,"You lose focus because you don't understand what the lecturer is saying.

Your brain then goes into hibernation mode to conserve energy since there is no reason to expend precious energy on gibberish that you don't understand.

Pre-read your lecture notes to familiarize your brain with the material so you don't get lost so easily during the lecture.  Sit at the front and stop the lecturer whenever you don't understand something. Most lecturers welcome questions, it makes the lecture more engaging for them too."
taenyfan95,47,"You need to read with a purpose. Do not read for the sake of reading. The former is active learning and stimulates the mind. The latter is passive learning and dulls the mind. 

For example, if you need to fix a light bulb in your room, you'd sit down and read that instruction manual with no restlessness whatsoever. However, if you light bulb is working fine and I instruct you to read the manual, you'd get bored and lose focus quickly. 

Look at your homework/tutorial problems before reading your 19 page articles. Read with the purpose of solving your homework problems. You'd find it a much more enjoyable experience this way."

I personally did both with very little prior experience, so the learning curve was steep for me. Doing a useful project was more important to me than the level, so ended up not meeting certain requirements and ended up getting downgraded."

TheJerryntom,6,"Expected salary is probably more tied with the job itself than what major you are studying in.

Most management associate programmes (which are not that particular about what major you study in) probably start around $4-5k. Same for most civil service roles. 

Then you have the more specialised roles for data analysts and software engineers that are above that (>$6k? Might be wrong cause not a sector I am that aware of). 

Next you have those high finance/bulge bank salaries that start from $10k. The biz girl that said $10k is not really wrong if she is aiming for IB like you said (I mean one can see expected salary = salary that you wish and desire). Then again, only a handful can get these roles each year, especially when the competition is so high.

Some specialised majors (e.g. Medicine, Dentistry, Food Science, Pharmacy etc) probably have more narrow ranges for their salaries since they are most likely going to work in specific sectors related to the major (which is also why there tends to be quotas for these majors). Engineering kinda falls under here as well.

But how many within the whole graduating cohort can get these salaries is another thing, especially with an uncertain economic outlook like now. Not to mention most roles tend to have set quotas, such as the MA programmes."

thePranksterGod,38,"No extra points for leadership so no one wants to be leader. 

In my experience in uni, even though I'm an introvert, I'm also the leader for most group projects because I feel more confident about the module content. Your group will be happy if there's a clear leader, and you don't have to put in a lot of extra effort. You just need to schedule weekly meetings, designate some tasks to group members and set some deadlines. During weekly meetings, set a basic agenda and try to facilitate the meeting. You can also take the lead to setup the project folder, documents, etc. In the end, by taking charge of the project you also have more say on how you want the project to be structured. 

Group projects generally have peer evaluation so if you feel like you contributed a lot more than your group members, feel free to write about how much more you contributed by leading the group. No shame. If your group members are happy about your leadership, they will also evaluate you fairly."

throwaway209152,8,"If you already know what u wna do (ie consulting/IB like you said), BBA is a degree that literally prepares you for it. QF is very mathy and closer to business analytics and econs than finance itself. Most of them end up in analytics roles, which isnt what you are looking for. And perhaps the main reason why bba wld be better in your case, would be the network opportunity that will help you land your first ib/consult role.

throwawayaway539,4," job market for non CS jobs is still strong. I'm referring to engineering, nursing etc"
throwawayaway539,96,"

The horizontal red line denotes mean salary of all majors. 

Pharmaceutical Science is the most difficult to get in but has one of the lowest median starting pay

Conversely, Industrial Engineering has a lower entry score but has a median salary of >$5.2k

For most engineering majors, there seems to be an increase in salary, as previously it was relatively constant over the years.

Salary for CS majors increased as usual. (but the survey was done before all the exciting news of the layoffs)."

What bond-free scholarships with fully paid tuition can i get with 90 RP (4 H2) PCME at NUS CS? I only have a very average portfolio (just a member of a CCA and self-initiated VIA) What are my chances? 

Heard that its possible to get merit scholarship without interview w 90 RP , dont know how true this is , can anyone attest to this? 

Can any uni scholarship holder or people who tried share their experience eg. interview process, rp , portfolio etc (wouldn‚Äôt mind any advice for organisation scholarships as well!!) 

thanks a lot!!!"
throwawaydelldude,1,No. 2 from the right. Less amount of splashing if you shoot with a high speed.
throwawaydumbcrow,1,i shit you not i got about 35% overall grades for a module once and still passed with B-
throwawaySgrean,2,Just wanted to reassure you that it's normal. I took it in Y2S2 with no background knowledge of info sec and spent the full 2 weeks on each assignment. Expected a B+ at best but got an A- to my surprise in the end.
throwawaySgrean,0,No
throwawaySgrean,11,"It really depends on your goals.

The median CS student has to take at least a 6 mth internship or 2x summer internships to graduate.

However if you're aiming for places with stricter resume screens like FAANG or HFTs, people typically have at least 2 internships before getting an internship at those places in your third year. So that makes at least 2 + 1 top tier intern before you graduate.

That said, I'm in my final year and I have 5 and some of my other friends who landed top tier firms as a new graduate typically have 4 (including part time internships during the semester).

Personally I prefer working to studying so that explains why I did so many internships."
throwawaySgrean,2,"1.	I just love finding out **exactly** how things work. When I have a question about something, I go all the way down to the implementation details to understand what's going on, rather than accepting some part of a black box. 
2.	Double degree math + cs. Quant trading / research interview is basically math. Quant dev depends on company but it's usually a mix of math and CS. SWE at Quant firm is pure CS down to low level details of how a CPU / RAM works. That said, your degree doesn't rly matter in getting into Quant, there are some people who got in with a Physics degree."
throwawaySgrean,9,"Depends entirely on major and which industry you want to work in, for computing, if you're able to land a HFT, you could reasonably expect 15k for a mid tier firm, to 25-40k for a top tier firm. That said, each firm hires around 5-10 new grads a year for each role, so it's really just about whether you can make it."
throwawaySgrean,2,"Typically around 20-30 people get selected for each batch of NOC SV, I only had 1 round of interview."
throwawaySgrean,5,"I'm ex-NOC SV, as another dude has mentioned, it depends on the interviewing team. I had friends who had hostile interviews and still passed. I think as long as you showed some passion and ability to defend your ideas with sound reasoning, that's the type of people they're looking for."
throwawaySgrean,4,"By and large, in tertiary education, you are expected to be self-sufficient a lot of the times. What this means is that if there's something you are unsure of / that was not taught, you are expected to pick up the slack yourself and find out about it on your own time.

I think this is the main reason why you get people at almost every university claiming their university is a ""self-study"" university, because this is basically a requirement throughout tertiary education, and could lead people to claim that the teaching quality is low.

Do I feel the teaching quality is low? If you expect to understand everything just from going to a lecture once, you'd better be a genius, else you'd likely be disappointed. I don't think it's because of a low teaching quality though, I just don't expect to understand anything in uni at one go during the lecture since I'm not that smart to connect all the dots at once.

That said, are there certain modules I feel that are of low teaching quality? Hell yes. These are the modules where even after listening to lectures, you feel like you still have a lot of dots left to connect by yourself."
throwawaySgrean,3,"Y4 CS, doing SWE in Quant, happy to help."
throwawaySgrean,5,"Took CS2107 in one of the earlier semesters with no prior knowldge.

Assignments were a bit tough and I had to take the entire 2 weeks for both assignments, did it myself for the most part with help from a friend and YouTube.

Achieved an above average grade in the end, which was unexpected as I was ready to tank a B initially."
thunkpad5121,3,Thinkpad is the gold standard :)

topupwater,63,"Hi, local CS student here

1. I'm not too sure of the rationale behind excluding exchanger students from modules. But I thought you would have done some preliminary research first before deciding to come to NUS :)
2. Mod reg is open for 27 hours. Unless your flight is 27 hours long, idt you would miss modreg
3. As what you mentioned, merging PDF is a good way to overcome this
4. Enrolment of module is done by modreg team actually. At least for computing and business school, there is a page with contacts of all the module coordinators. Not too sure about FASS side
5. Modreg is managed by humans and of course mistakes/errors might occur. But this is the rare minority. Most of my friends do not have any issues with modreg. For errors when u try to apply, it may be a variety of reasons such as module not open for bidding yet, havent fulfilled prerequisites, clashing timetables etc. I think they would have stated the type of error

Of course there are shortfalls. But at least we are definitely better than NTU by miles ahead. Their registration is first come first serve. So you would have to camp at the computer, just like securing concert tickets. People named it star wars (their system is called star)

Cheers! Hope that regardless of your terrible modreg experience, you will enjoy the rest of the sem"

twilightaurorae,5,"It really depends on the professor/supervisor you are working for, some expect more and some are more chill.

Depending on your supervisor, you will either be tasked to come out with your own research idea, or help them on some tasks. General tasks include doing a literature review (and writing) and possibly data cleaning. If the research project is based on field work, then you might be asked to transcribe interviews (i.e. convert audio into text).

Some supervisors may give you more straightforward tasks like reference management, referencing, editing of manuscripts.

You are welcome to ask more questions (my experience is limited to psychology, economics, sociology and *some* political science)"

3. Time management: Make a schedule to balance academics, self-care and leisure activities.
4. Reach out for support: Talk to friends, family, a tutor or a counselor for emotional support and advice.
5. Practice relaxation techniques: Use mindfulness, deep breathing or meditation to manage stress levels.
6. Start the essay early: Break down the essay writing process into smaller steps, research, outlining, writing, and editing.
7. Seek extra help if needed: Consider reaching out to your professor, TA or tutoring services for help."

vajraadhvan,9,"No need to feel bad if you quit suddenly, companies don't care about you, you're just a expendable source of revenue for them. Any guilt about quitting is due to (imo toxic) societal norms. If you don't desperately need the extra money, and you would much prefer to focus on your internship, I'd say there's nothing wrong with quitting."
vajraadhvan,2,"If you're interested in understanding the intricacies of human cognition, there are many roads leading to Rome, so to speak; Computer Science is certainly one of them. What you are describing is a monumental task, and many people believe that the closest we can get to understanding cognition is by fusing statistical-connectionist approaches, (ie deep learning and its allied methods) and logico-deductive symbolic approaches (ie formal methods, theorem provers, previously expert systems).

At the same time, the undergrad CS curriculum has many elements which are only tangential to your aims. For example, it is unlikely that CS2102 or CS2103 will help you further your goals much.

If you're not thrilled by your experience of CS50x, then it's probably wise to reconsider what you want to study in undergrad. Stanford has a programme called [Symbolic Systems](https://symsys.stanford.edu), which fuses CS, Linguistics, Maths, Philosophy, Psychology, Statistics, and more. While there is no comparable undergrad programme in SG, these are all fields well worth taking a look at. For example, you may be delighted to hear (anecdotally at least) that, given time to catch up, philosophy majors excel at graduate maths due to their experience with arguments (relaxing/strengthening assumptions, abstraction, proof techniques).

If your endgoal is quant finance, then you'll need at least a MSc/MPhil for buy-side quant research or almost all sell-side quant roles. If you already have a graduate programme in mind, look at the admission requirements, which can give you some leeway re: your choice of undergraduate major.

Ultimately, don't choose between CS or non-CS based (solely) on regret minimisation. Go with a major that you think you will really be able to enjoy, and that you will be passionate enough about to network with peers & profs and do research meaningfully."

VeryAmbitiousPerson,1,"Hi, currently just a polytechnic student applying for university. I had always wanted to do a degree in life science at NUS, and not much has changed since then on my part.

But recently, I found out FOS has merger with FASS to form CHS. With the merger, the common curriculum has also been employed. Looking at the common curriculum as a person who excel only in science and math, humanities and social sciences module is, no offences but such a turn off. Which I believe the student on both ends thinks because the nature of 2 subject is one being ‚Äòsubjective‚Äô while the other being ‚Äònon-subjective‚Äô.

Thus, I was hoping some CHS student could enlighten me on how was it like in terms of the modules and difficulties, especially those who wanted to only go life science."

w3yg4nd,11,"Don‚Äôt do it, EE is a fucking trap. But then again with anything coming out of NUS, take my words and anyone else‚Äôs with a pinch of salt.

I see part of your motivation here is starting pay. The amount of work you will find yourself putting into EE is hardly worth it. By your fourth semester you‚Äôd still be doing calculus. In fact, you‚Äôd be doing so much applied math even a math major would scoff and say they don‚Äôt do calculus as complex as ours. The recent curriculum change has even thrown in so much non engineering mods that you might struggle in the course, even if a few of those mods are helpful or meaningful.

Also, the starting pay only looks great towards the higher end, the median and lower end has little to no difference from other engineering courses. However, given your RP, if you don‚Äôt get into CS/CEG with it‚Äôs ivory towers and godly starting pays, EE can be an option for you. Many EE students failed to get into CS, failed to get into CEG and landed in EE to slog it out hoping to get a software job after graduation.

With all that being said, I believe EE will be important not just as a specialty, but as a connection between all other engineering majors + CS as tech advances. As I tell everyone, never take any course just for the pay, only interest in the course will take you far. 

btw I fucking hate EE"

Waste-Maybe6092,14,"Your Q1 and Q2 is rather contradicting.
On one hand you seek knowledge, on other its the dark side aka quant finance.

I think the underlying truth is you are doing CS for $ and trying to figure if you can stomach it. Q1 seems like a coping method to tell yourself it's interesting.

You can think of all the great meaning behind everything but at the end it's the process that you have to sit through, debugging is a prime example. Every job come with a downside, how bad is debugging for you? Usually if you are good at something, it doesn't bother you. If you don't have the aptitude for CS, everything is going to be an uphill battle. You can't mug CS. If everything else in CS apart from debugging is easy for you, you can train in that."

WesleyBLDC,1,The normal convention is to go NOC first then SEP. Usually not the other way around.
WesleyBLDC,3,"To be safe, I would just apply with your current CGPA and apply again next year with your final CGPA. 

I would also recommend looking into also applying through discretionary admission whereby they look at your grades and portfolio/CCAs/leadership/interest/passion/other stuff that you have done. This is a good route to go especially if your CGPA is very near or just at the cutoff point for the course you are looking for if you have some portfolio to show for or passion.

Try to take advantage of the fact that polytechnic students can apply 3 times for university after going through your army.

Also, do look into applying for scholarships and knowing the application dates for halls/residential colleges(something that most poly students are not aware of).

whalepetunias,1,"From CHS FAQ:
> No, you will not be directly admitted to the preferred major indicated in the application form. This is simply an indication of your course of preference and it is non-binding. This means that you can still revise your choice of major later on in the June-July period of the year of your enrolment as an H&S student under the CHS. After you have successfully gained admission to the H&S course, you will also not be subject to quota restrictions on a major that you have decided to read within this course.

And while I can‚Äôt find it in the FAQ, I remember them clarifying multiple times during the admissions process that neither declaring interest in a highly demanded major (eg psych, life science) nor declaring ‚Äúmajor to be decided later‚Äù disadvantages your application. The only difference might be in the ABA process or in scholarship applications.

Once you get admitted you will have to declare *something* as your major/2nd major for Y1S1, and your Y1S1 transcript will reflect as such. The only implication this has is that they will preallocate you the gateway module for your declared major (and 2nd major if you have the space due to programs like UTCP). Most of your modules will be the CHS common modules for Y1 though, so a large chunk of your curriculum will look the same as anyone else in CHS. And the gateway module you do in Y1S1 isn‚Äôt a binding contract to take that major. It will simply be converted to a UE if you later decide to pursue something else."

Personally I feel that, your preference for some general modules shouldn't deter you from going to a major that you want. And as some users commented you can use your S/U for the common mods.

To add on, it's not like BZA students can escape from writing or common curriculum mods either. BZA students also need fulfill their own general curriculum with their GE modules, which usually involves writing essays.

What about NTU? Well, they also have their own version of general curriculum and you cannot use your S/U for these according to my friends. So either way you can't escape writing.

In summary: Go for the course that you like."

xKart,4,"Currently in my 4th sem at RV.

1) Some modules are focused towards that so you'll have a chance to delve into it more if you want to. Some specific interest groups have been set up geared towards this if you're interested. RV also hosts guests from the industry to talk about working life in a sustainability/environment-focused niche. However, you'll find people from every major here - quite a lot of Business and Computing.

2) CS here, sorry!

3) I have window netting up, have practically never had an insect in my room, and I face the forest. You can request for that after getting in I believe (anecdotal experience from a friend switching sides). Like someone else said, there's always some awake (even at 3am) to help you remove an insect if it gets into your room.

4) At the start of next semester RV is hoping to have over 60% of rooms with aircon, so it'll be much easier than it was before.

5) I enjoyed the RV mods I've done so far, but only one of them was focused on the environment. Another was a critique and expression class on Science Fiction & Society - homework was watching Black Panther, Black Mirror, etc., another on workplace readiness, and the other is a class on exploring food in Singapore.

6) Not entirely sure about this. Rooms are bigger than all the other RCs, literally right beside the midterm/final exam centers so getting there takes about 5 mins (even in the rain), right beside the sports halls, right beside the sports field, right beside Science and Engineering, and about a 5-minute walk from CLB too. I can't stress how big the old block rooms are - they're only 0.75-1m shorter than the double rooms length-wise. Also, the RC isn't one big tower (but 2 houses do reside in our tower block), so it's pretty easy to walk around if you want air or want to enjoy the night. Lack of suite living might be it, but every block has communal spaces to hang out and there's a lot of block spirit, these spaces usually have people. I guess the lack of aircon would turn some people off, but that's obviously going up soon.

7) Interest in the programme, in our modules, in taking part and contributing to student life.

8) Not at all, mutually distinct from each other.

9) RV doesn't consider your grades in your application.

10) Slightly noisier than the blocks facing the bus stop, but overall quieter than the other RCs for sure. I had friends who couldn't sleep during the Supernova concert in UTown last year (not sure why they weren't at the concert though, peak student life)."

In reality, you may find some Chinese students start with Chinese by default when starting a conversation with an Asian-face person, which is not that good. My Korean and Vietnam friends say it happens a lot.

Another fact (out of the domain of NUS) is that SG locals can tell I'm not from Singapore when I start with English, then some of them will reply in Chinese. And one of my SG local (but not very good at Chinese) lab mate said he often received an English response when starting with Chinese."

Like some other comment says, try to have like a general roadmap on your mods, minding the prerequisites and whether some mods are only available in sem1/sem2.

Then u can plan the specifics yearly (at the start of sem1) because mod schedules refreshes every year.

Then just plan based on whatever u want haha. Plan so nothing clashes, plan to take with friends, plan the workload, see the prof teaching it, etc.

Also plan your mods wisely if you wanna do some full time projects like IA or semester internships cuz sometimes they only allow you to take minimal school workload. Might need to overload on certain sems. Etc."

zeindigofire,9,"A PhD is about research. The goal is that you will *literally* write the book on a particular subject that no one has figured out before you. My suggestion is to figure out what you want to research first, and then figure out the rest. If you have a clear research goal it's much easier to find a supportive prof with whom you work well - whether at NUS or elsewhere. Once you have those two, the PhD process is much easier.

But if you're doing a PhD just to do a PhD, be warned it will be difficult, and IMO not worth it."
